  "body": "I’ve tried to write this a few times but here we go. We met 4 years ago and we both worked at a grocery store as assistant department managers. I being a very young naive person when I met her has grown up a lot, but I’ve always had a problem working with significant others at work due to seeing them too much and having either life or work spill into the other so we don’t work together anymore. \n\nWe got married a year and half ago. The first year was rough(due to me being very resistant to change)We moved to a different state and bought a house and we both had decent jobs at the time but our first issue arose. Before we got married we had separate accounts but with the marriage we just combined everything. This became and issue for my wife and really created a-lot of resentment between the both of us(this is a lot better now)My resentment was due to my feelings of being over worked and under appreciated for the things I actually do. I do 70% of the work in and on the house. Cook and do 50% of the cleaning. I also bring in 75% of our total money from working two jobs. My wife used to bring in 50% of the money but when we moved she felt overwhelmed so she basically waited until a month before she quit to tell me she didn’t want to work there anymore. We’ve worked in the same industry for years and I understand it is a-lot and very demanding but I told her to wait to find an opportunity that will bring in the same amount of money but she left that job and found another job that paid half of her previous job(still currently)I was of course frustrated beyond belief only for the fact that my wife couldn’t convince that by her leaving her job that if we wanted to maintain the life we had, I would have to step up even more and bring in more money so we could live like we’re used to. But I bite my tongue as much as I could but she just kept asking me everyday for months how I felt about it. And eventually it started to boil over. How can I possibly feel differently if I have no time to think about it and truly accept it. This went on for months and we had extremely heated arguments without really seeing any real change. No matter what is said the situation sucked and I wasn’t going to change the way I felt about the situation but I made the choice everyday to ignore how I felt to make sure my wife was alright. Well maybe not the right choice because I lost bits of myself every time we would argue and I had to make a permanent change to my mind frame . \n\nI am not a perfect person and I have problems but I have spent the last 6 months truly looking at myself and seeing where I was the problem and trying to fix my thought processes to become a better person. I’ve come so far on myself but I still have a lot of room to grow but I’m better than last year. The more I work on myself I see the actions that my wife takes and I can’t agree with the way she acts anymore. She’s been hurt too much and has way to many insecurities for me as a single person to help her and keep the life that now I’m supporting. It’s too much. I’m 25 and still figuring out how things work and it takes a toll on me everyday but I’ve found ways to keep myself motivated and keep going. Until last night. \n\nMy wife texted me because she got her schedule for work and she has Valentine’s Day off(which she didn’t request off). She asked if I had Valentine’s Day off and I said no I didn’t. I’m a department manager now and I have responsibilities around holidays because I work in grocery stores and I don’t get any holidays off besides thanksgiving and Christmas which is understood but now that my wife has holidays off now and expects me to have these holidays off to spend with her which is fine if I can make it work but it doesn’t always work out. Anyways she made a couple light hearted jokes when she was at work after I told her I count get the day off but then we she got in the door from work I was cooking Dinner and she blew up on me. She’s threatened now twice to go into work and make a scene just so I could get certain days off. She threatens me with divorce maybe once a month and to take half of all my shit. I understand you say things in the heat of the moment but I don’t see how you can share a bed with someone who just told you we should get divorced and I’m taking half your shit. \n\nI’m to the point where I was researching narcissism and I thought it was all my fault but the more time that passes and the more actions I fix of my own the more I’m left with the reality that it’s not all my fault. I can’t even exist without a word coming out her mouth about whatever I’m doing.  If anyone has questions I’m more than happy to explain further in comments. There is still hope I’m just at my wits end right now. I’m tired and I just want to be left alone to do my own thing. \n\nI just feel defeated and tired. I don’t know what to do. Is it worth the effort to make work. I’m young and in shape and my wife hasn’t worked out in two years  and has gained a good 30 pounds and she’s been dealing with this rash but simple to say I’m not attracted to her like I used to be. She doesn’t put in the effort to work on her self and I’ve seen no real change in anything, yet she keeps asking for more. More time, more love and affection. She wants the house fixed up and she wants to go on vacation which is fine but to Spain for a family wedding on my side. It will cost probably 2k for the whole trip which is doable but it takes up a good chunk of our savings so it stresses me out. She wants all this stuff but is unwilling to help me at all. I just have to figure it out. But after last night I don’t even want to look at her. I feel helpless. I’m done changing and making myself better to have to share that with someone who will not do the same for me",

I understand you say things in the heat of the moment but I don’t see how you can share a bed with someone who just told you we should get divorced and I’m taking half your shit. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m to the point where I was researching narcissism and I thought it was all my fault but the more time that passes and the more actions I fix of my own the more I’m left with the reality that it’s not all my fault. I can’t even exist without a word coming out her mouth about whatever I’m doing.  If anyone has questions I’m more than happy to explain further in comments. There is still hope I’m just at my wits end right now. I’m tired and I just want to be left alone to do my own thing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I just feel defeated and tired. I don’t know what to do. Is it worth the effort to make work. I’m young and in shape and my wife hasn’t worked out in two years  and has gained a good 30 pounds and she’s been dealing with this rash but simple to say I’m not attracted to her like I used to be. She doesn’t put in the effort to work on her self and I’ve seen no real change in anything, yet she keeps asking for more. More time, more love and affection. She wants the house fixed up and she wants to go on vacation which is fine but to Spain for a family wedding on my side. It will cost probably 2k for the whole trip which is doable but it takes up a good chunk of our savings so it stresses me out. She wants all this stuff but is unwilling to help me at all. I just have to figure it out. But after last night I don’t even want to look at her. I feel helpless. I’m done changing and making myself better to have to share that with someone who will not do the same for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I used to spend hours watching random curiosity videos and seeing pages with this type of content. When I'm excited and anxious about a game or movie that is coming out I tend to look up information about it, cause I want to know more about that thing.\n\nI spend hours seeing theories about games i like, especially Zelda, and when Undertale was still on hype I would look up to new alternative universes, fanfics and theories. I'm autistic, so seeing stuff about my special interests is almost a necessity, i get obsessed over stuff for a few weeks or months.\n\nI've always been like this, especially to stuff that I'm passionate about. I'm also a very anxious person, and it's hard for me to sit still while waiting for something to happen. I would rather take action, and when I can't i get paralized.\n\nThis behaviour never really bothered anyone. But today my boyfriend said it's unhealthy. He always said that I gather a lot of \"useless information\" about stuff when I could really be looking at stuff that would help me in the future or on being a better person. But today i commented on how i wanted to see more Zelda theories for the new game that is coming out in three months, since it's something that I've been looking up to since the first trailer on 2019 and he said he hated those videos, because they go way too far into it and add up a lot of crazy stuff on it (he isn't wrong).\n\nHe said my hunger for information makes mix what's real and what's it's theory, and it's unhealthy. A game it's not reality, it's a thing that is imagined. I don't go looking up for theories about real world events or anything like conspiracy theories. I watch this kind of content to relief my anxiety and as entertainment. But the fact that he got bothered by it made me second guess if it's really unhealthy. I do get frustrated on not finding information about stuff I want to learn or know about. Especially when it's some information I would have to pay for it and I have no money at the moment. I won't throw a tantrum, just get frustrated about it.\n\n\nI'm also a person that overthinks a lot and daydream a bunch too. I have memory issues, I tend to forget stuff easily, so I do rewatch the same videos more than once since I forget the content entirely sometimes. I never saw it as a waste of time, since it's always as entertaining as the first time. I don't make him watch this kind of stuff with me and I learned to keep my random informations to myself, since he doesn't like random informations.\n\nSo, it's my hunger for information really unhealthy?\n\nPs: My bf is a gamer and he knows a lot of stuff about certain games, like knowing animals names on Arc, which ones can be tamed, some curiosities about games he does likes...he also is making characters and creating a completely new of his own, that I absolutely love. I wonder what differ this from wanting to know more about fictional worlds that I like as well and when does it becomes unhealthy.",

When I&amp;#39;m excited and anxious about a game or movie that is coming out I tend to look up information about it, cause I want to know more about that thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I spend hours seeing theories about games i like, especially Zelda, and when Undertale was still on hype I would look up to new alternative universes, fanfics and theories. I&amp;#39;m autistic, so seeing stuff about my special interests is almost a necessity, i get obsessed over stuff for a few weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been like this, especially to stuff that I&amp;#39;m passionate about. I&amp;#39;m also a very anxious person, and it&amp;#39;s hard for me to sit still while waiting for something to happen. I would rather take action, and when I can&amp;#39;t i get paralized.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This behaviour never really bothered anyone. But today my boyfriend said it&amp;#39;s unhealthy. He always said that I gather a lot of &amp;quot;useless information&amp;quot; about stuff when I could really be looking at stuff that would help me in the future or on being a better person. But today i commented on how i wanted to see more Zelda theories for the new game that is coming out in three months, since it&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;ve been looking up to since the first trailer on 2019 and he said he hated those videos, because they go way too far into it and add up a lot of crazy stuff on it (he isn&amp;#39;t wrong).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said my hunger for information makes mix what&amp;#39;s real and what&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s theory, and it&amp;#39;s unhealthy. A game it&amp;#39;s not reality, it&amp;#39;s a thing that is imagined. I don&amp;#39;t go looking up for theories about real world events or anything like conspiracy theories. I watch this kind of content to relief my anxiety and as entertainment. But the fact that he got bothered by it made me second guess if it&amp;#39;s really unhealthy. I do get frustrated on not finding information about stuff I want to learn or know about. Especially when it&amp;#39;s some information I would have to pay for it and I have no money at the moment. I won&amp;#39;t throw a tantrum, just get frustrated about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also a person that overthinks a lot and daydream a bunch too. I have memory issues, I tend to forget stuff easily, so I do rewatch the same videos more than once since I forget the content entirely sometimes. I never saw it as a waste of time, since it&amp;#39;s always as entertaining as the first time. I don&amp;#39;t make him watch this kind of stuff with me and I learned to keep my random informations to myself, since he doesn&amp;#39;t like random informations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#39;s my hunger for information really unhealthy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps: My bf is a gamer and he knows a lot of stuff about certain games, like knowing animals names on Arc, which ones can be tamed, some curiosities about games he does likes...he also is making characters and creating a completely new of his own, that I absolutely love. I wonder what differ this from wanting to know more about fictional worlds that I like as well and when does it becomes unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I would see her all the time still due to all the mutual friends and every once in a while we would hang out just the two of us which would be a great time.\n\nOver the last two years, life drifted as we moved to different places and we pretty much only were checking in with each other and seeing each other couple times a year. However a couple of months ago we went on a short trip together and had a super fun time together.\n\nSince then we've been texting pretty much every day for the last 3 months. At first I didn't think much of it as we were catching up, but the longer it went on I began thinking that this might be a little bit dangerous and is not something either of us would normally do with just a friend. Along with having so many mutual friends with her significant other, I'm really worried this could blow up and is not a good thing to continue.\n\nI'd love to still be good friends with her and have her in my life of course, but I don't think those feelings will ever fully go away and some small part of me still thinks something could happen. I don't want to be disrespectful to her relationship though of course and am trying to shut down these feelings, but honestly I have really enjoyed talking with her these last couple months. Is it dangerous to keep this up? Should I just try to end it?\n\nThoughts appreciated.",

  "body": "I’m struggling to forgive my wife for something I don’t think I should be mad about.\n\nHere’s the story. I (23 M) and my wife (22f) have been together since I was 18 and she was 17. We dated for 4 before we got married. And we’ve now been married for a year. My wife went away to college after high school about two hours away from home and I decided to stay and work at my parents business.\n\n During this time my parents paid me hardly any money and I worked approximately 75-80 hours a week just to squeeze by on gas to get to work and my bills. As you can probably guess I did not get to see my wife (the girlfriend) very often. I was always at work and if I asked off I was pressured into working so my mom (who worked even more hours than me at the time) wouldn’t have to cover for me. So I saw my wife once a month while she was in school. And when she was home from break we didn’t see each other much either due to my high volume work schedule. This went on for about 3 and a half years in college. By the end of year one of college we got engaged. And hardly ever saw each other. We were set to get married right after she graduated. The semester before she graduated she started managing a men’s sports team for scholarship money and by the end of the season she had known a few of the guys. \n\nFast forward to our 5 year anniversary or dating. We’ve been married almost a year and I’m feeling a little down. My wife on our first Christmas together was given a journal from my parents and I decide ya know what, there’s probably something in there about me that is pretty nice. So I decide to read it. I go through and there are tons of nice things about me the first year. The second year is the same. The third year, her sophomore year of college she writes frequently of men that she is meeting and hanging out with that she might be developing feelings for while we’re apart and often compares me to them. Saying their tall (which I am not) and handsome and sweet etc. Nothing ever comes of these things. Her junior year is Covid and her last semester is the year after. \n\nI read for a while about she misses me so badly and has an incredibly high libido and this is all about 6 months before our wedding. After the sports season ends she starts talking to a guy, let’s call him Mike. Mike is a part of the sports team she manages and they were on a bus together and he was apparently very charming. He asks to hang out and she says yes and over the course of the next few months she hangs out with him as friends but is lying to me about who she is with. Then it happens I read in her journal that she has a “sneaky link” and they have sex twice, and after that he ghosts her. She compares us in bed saying he’s bigger but I’m better and that it’s hard to blame her because the distance had been so much. \n\nI can’t believe what I’ve read and I call her while she’s at work and let her know that I know. She comes home crying and sobbing begging for forgiveness, I’m hugging her and trying to help her calm down and tells me she wants a second chance, she still talks to Mike on Snapchat from time to time so she blocks him, and I tell her to call her sister over and I leave to see some friends and try to figure out what to do. \n\nI come back with more questions than answers and we talk about the logistics of it. How when where why. She says they were just friends and he kissed her and she told him to stop, he tried again and she says no. A third and he tries again. Then finally she gives in and they have sex. To me that’s not sex. She was SA’d and didn’t realize. Then the following time she was having a mental breakdown crying and she reached out to all her friends and no one answers, except for him. And then after he tries to help her they have sex again. Which to me also sounds SA’ish. If not at least low and pathetic. \n\nThen I tell her I want to stay together and while I felt she was SA’d I can’t unsee what she said about me. About how she compared us. About how she enjoyed it and justified it when she thought she was cheating. It’s been 4 months and while I was doing very well something last night set me off and I’ve been thinking about it ever since.\n\nEDIT: I’m not super into arguing the logistics of consent with people in the comments. No means no. It’s one thing to say that she’s lying I understand that thought process. It’s another to say she’s telling the truth but consent doesn’t matter in sex. Y’all are weird for that.",

A good therapist is a great resource- they can practically run simulations in their brains to provide feedback on directions you can go and predict outcomes because they've seen / heard just about everything. \n\nI highly recommend doing as little as possible with communicating with him right now- you have children, so you have to manage best interests of the children, and that includes having their father be in their lives with visitation.  But you don't have to talk about your relationship or anything about you, you can leave if he comes to your house or insist he takes the kiddos to McDonalds.  \n\nSometimes space gives people perspective, time to simmer down.  This time period might give you both time to try on what being separated feels / looks like.  It may also give him time to reflect on what having 50% access to his children and 0% access to you feels like and vice versa if you're thinking about separation.\n\nDuring this time, you should also research adoption- look at the legal process, research other people's experiences with familial adoptions to gauge how you'll feel before/during/after, get an understanding if SIL REALLY desires this child for her own reasons- or is just willing to take on the responsibility.  If your SIL truly desires to adopt this child for her own reasons, your husband hearing that from her might help.  \n\nThis is big.

  "parsedCommunityName": "relationship_advice",
  "body": "I’ve been with my boyfriend for a a little over a year now and we never really had any serious problems until recently. About a few months ago I told him that his relationship with one of his female friends made me uncomfortable. He would comment on all her posts, they would both save photos of each other on snapchat, and they would ft regularly. I’ve brought it up multiple times that i’m uncomfortable with how close they are but nothing ever changed. After my 3rd attempt I pretty much gave up and told him it was me or her. I mean he didn’t have to completely stop being her friend just not be so close. The reason I’m most upset is because he was uncomfortable with one of my friendships so I stopped be so close with my friend and I just expected the same from him. Well recently- about a week ago, my boyfriend told me he doesn’t think he can do a relationship and wanted to take a break.

  "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been with my boyfriend for a a little over a year now and we never really had any serious problems until recently. About a few months ago I told him that his relationship with one of his female friends made me uncomfortable. He would comment on all her posts, they would both save photos of each other on snapchat, and they would ft regularly. I’ve brought it up multiple times that i’m uncomfortable with how close they are but nothing ever changed. After my 3rd attempt I pretty much gave up and told him it was me or her. I mean he didn’t have to completely stop being her friend just not be so close. The reason I’m most upset is because he was uncomfortable with one of my friendships so I stopped be so close with my friend and I just expected the same from him. Well recently- about a week ago, my boyfriend told me he doesn’t think he can do a relationship and wanted to take a break. After some talking we figured out our problems and decided to stay together. But, since then I haven’t felt the same. I’m hurt that he wouldn’t tell me how he was feeling and just decided to break up with me, and i found out that nothing had changed between him and his friend and that they are still close. I really don’t know what to do, and i feel horrible for feeling this way. I just don’t know if my feelings are as strong for him as they were before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Over the last couple of months I’ve had my suspicions he was cheating  due to him still having dating apps as well as him lying about things such as his location and his use of the dating apps. Recently he gave me his phone to show me a funny video and I ended up seeing a sex tape that was recent in his camera role. He then proceeded to go to Snapchat where I saw he had been having conversations with local guys than I know get around a lot. In addition to these two, a dating app (Jack’d) notification appeared at the top of the screen as we watched this funny video. I respectfully confronted and asked him about the tape, guys, and the notification. His response was that the guy he made the tape with wanted him to to send it back, all the guys who messaged him on snapchat wanted to have sex with him but he denied, and he has Jack’d to check out what’s happening and be nosy, not for sexual pleasure. I was a fool and thought I’d just been paranoid and moved on from the situation. \n\nYesterday I was over his house and saw Jack’d notifications on his home screen so I decided I’d had enough. Because we were in the same room and I didn’t want the distance to show that he was within a certain radius of me, I had my friend make a fake account and message him until I’d make my way over to her house to text him directly. He didn’t text the account at first so I decided to leave the room to go the bathroom. The moment I left in the room, he texted the account. My friend engaged in small talk with him before I came back. When I came back I conversed with him like nothing was wrong and after about an hour I decided it was late and I’d get  to leaving. The moment I left his house, he texted the account again. \n\nI drove to my friends house and we together continued texting James. Through the conversation James gave sexual information away such as “I’m a top” “I can host”, and “I’m free whenever”. I also decided to text him off the account and asked him if he wanted ice cream the the next day, and he said yes and he was going to sleep. The entire time was still  engaging in conversation with the account. After an hour of crying and responding \nI decided to blow his phone with calls until he answered and addressed everything I felt. \n\nHe told me he felt like we needed to take things slow and apologized for texting the account. I told him he needed to delete the app if he wanted to be with me and he never confirmed he would and still has the app downloaded . He only danced in circles out of what seemed like embarrassment.

She thought that one of them was particularly creative and fun even if it is outrageously complicated compared to what should be aiming for. However, she said she really liked my ideas and that I might like this book that it reminded her of. We continued chatting to the point where the next lecturer who had been waiting outside came in and kicked us out.\n\nSo needless to say I was thinking about this interaction and while physically I wouldn’t say she’s my type, I just found myself drawn to her humour and intelligence. So I mentioned the idea of asking her out for a drink to my friend, who said that she also has a little crush on one of the lecturers and that I should go for it.\n\nMy housemates think it’s going to be a train-wreck but are perfectly happy to let me participate in that train wreck and for me to tell them about it afterwards. \n\nI also chatted to my two best friends who’ve left Uni, who said that there are some significant ethics issues involved, especially if she will be marking some of my work, so to wait until after the semester has ended before making a move. Hopefully if I’m no longer a student at the Uni, then her job won’t be under threat if someone did find out about it. Between now and then I had thought that there can definitely be some casual flirting, and I don’t see a problem with that.\n\nI do want to say that we’ve had a couple of other fun, almost flirty moments but I didn’t really think too much about it until we had spent a good 10-15 minutes getting lost in conversation.\n\nSo I would like to know three things.\n\n1.

You may be in a position to make a move but, that becomes less likely as time goes on. You’ll be in a relationship, you’ll be recovering from heartbreak, you’ll have an STD, you’ll be depressed and broke and barely surviving…and a multitude of other variables in life that render you unavailable. \n\nSo, you’ll have no choice but to let them sail right past you. They’ll linger in your mind for a while and you might catch a glimpse of them again but, they will fade and inevitably, you’ll find another celestial wonderment and it’s starts all over again. \n\nAlso, not everyone who we think is amazing at first glance ACTUALLY is. Some people are paid to be charismatic and engaging and charming but, that’s not necessarily WHO THEY ARE. You’re seeing one side, one slice of a complex person. \n\nGet used to it. Accept it. Enjoy the time you have with that person at that time. Some people in life we view as a distant star. Some, we actually collide with and create sparks. Some will even hover close and fade away.

When my ex told me who he was, I was about to hang up, but my boyfriend told me to stay on the line and speak with him.  Probably because he wanted to hear how we interacted.  I asked my ex what he wanted and he said he just wanted to know how I was.  I said fine, and to please not call me again.  \n\nMy boyfriend was very upset with me because he believes I made myself \"accessible\" to him still after we broke up.  I wanted to make sure it would never happen again so I changed my number.\n\nI never heard from my ex again until 3 days ago when he messaged me on Facebook messenger asking, \"Just curious, why the unusual unblock all of a sudden?\".  My heart sank because I knew my boyfriend would be very upset about this and it wouldn't feel right to keep this from him.  I immediately blocked him on messenger, then went to my Facebook app to double check my blocked contacts.  He wasn't listed there. I went to block him but it gave me an error message saying I am unable to block someone that I had unblocked less than 48 hours ago.  This was strange because I did not unblock him!\n\nI asked my boyfriend if he had logged into on my Facebook, thinking maybe he was snooping around, but he said no.  Then I told him about the message I received from my ex.  He lost it.  He asked why I unblocked him. If I still wanted something with him.  If I had been speaking to him this whole time.  Obviously I hadn't. He does not believe that I did not unblock him and honestly I don't blame him because how can this happen on its own? Now my boyfriend feels he cannot trust me and he is considering breaking up. \n\nOnly today I was able to block my ex after the 48 hours had passed.\n\nCan anyone help explain this?

He decided to quit both cold turkey last October. I witnessed his psychosis episode. We were supposed to go on a date that day, on my way to his apartment, he started to text me some weird stuff, he was pretty normal before that day. That day was his third day withdrawal. I stayed with him that night and sent him to the ER the next morning. He was then sent to a mental hospital for three weeks in-patient treatment. He was put on zyprexa this time. He also started addiction talk therapy. Ever since he started his therapy, he started to mention that the therapist suggest him to not be in a relationship in the beginning of recovery. But we still maintained our regular dating routine.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he had mentioned to me that we spent to much time together during the weekend. He ghosted me for ten days after our last date. Finally reached out two days ago to schedule a call for yesterday afternoon. He texted me that there's something I needed to talk to you about. I sensed that he probably will break up with me over the phone. So I texted him that if you are going to break up me, please do it in person. He did not reply. Yesterday afternoon, he called on the scheduled time to break up with me. His words are scripted. It's like someone is telling him what to say. Not the way he would normally talk to me. He said the reason for the break up is that he has too much going on in his life, the timing was not right. He reassured me that its not me or anything I did or said.\n\nI haven't seen him for ten days. He live by himself. His not close to his family, he only have two friends who was not aware his mental health problem. I do not have his family nor friend's contact. I was worried about his wellbeing due to I witnessed his previous psychosis episode. I told him I would go to his apartment to check on him. He told me he couldn't see me in-person. I went anyway.\n\nI went to his apartment and he wouldn't let me in in the beginning. Turned out it was the therapist who instructed him not to let me in. But eventually, he let me in. We were sitting next to each other on the couch. This was 10:00PM. He already took his medication for the day. Someone texted him and then he said you need to leave. I asked who's texting you so late? He said it was his therapist. He started to talk to this female therapist two month ago. I am not sure if she knew I was there with him during his last episode. After the text, she the therapist called him twice, each time is asking him to ask me to leave and tell him to call the cops to remove me. She also texted to ask him to call the cops. He texted her back that we were fine. No need to call the cops. And then the therapist texted I am concerned and I call the cops. If she cooperate, she wouldn't be arrested. He showed me all the texts between him and the therapist. I was shocked that this therapist texted my boyfriend to tell him to break up with me over the phone and instructed him through his conversation during the call when he broke up with me. And instructed and pushed him to call the cops to remove me. But my boyfriend would not and insisted that he wouldn't call the cop. Then the therapist called the cop to remove me. I left after the cop get there, my boyfriend explained everything to the cop, we were just talking. They left.\n\nI will not contact my now ex-boyfriend again.  I want the best for him. I hope he can recover. But this whole situation made me feel like the therapist was manipulating my now ex-boyfriend to break up with me. I am not sure if her behavior is ethical. I remember one time my ex-boyfriend mentioned to me that this therapist said he more than likely had schizophrenia since his mother had it. He said his psychiatrist said he did not have schizophrenia. He said he didn't like the therapist. But what happened now just confused me so much.",

  "body": "**TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nI had a past where I struggled to say \"no,\" but now after a year of therapy and learning to set boundaries I'm starting to question myself if my actual judgment is compromised because of our toxic past.\n\nContext:\n\nGF has never liked the relationship I have with one of my best friends \\[F27\\] let's call her Luna, GF has no reason to hate Luna, she has never done anything to her but  she swears it's because I trust her so much (apparently you can only trust your GF) and because she has a \"bad vibe\" whatever that means, from the beginning of the relationship with GF Luna knew the situation and she came to me saying \"I know your girlfriend doesn't like me but now she is my best friend's girlfriend and I respect that decision, we are still friends\".\n\nIn 3 years of relationship, the first two years were a disaster, a very toxic and controlling environment from GF, GF wouldn't let me greet Luna or even send her a message on her birthday because it would be very hurtful for GF and I ended up giving her what she wanted, the problem is that in all that time I let those things continue to happen because it was difficult for me to say \"no\" (My bad there), never actually stood for my limits and boundaries and ended up distancing myself from Luna.\n\nA year ago I was at a breaking point because now the situation was not only against Luna, now it was also against other friends, my family, my time and my space. Everyone began to notice the change and as I moved away from all those people who were so important to me it began to eat me up from the inside and at that breaking point I decided to give ourselves some time.\n\nAt that time I started therapy and I felt that I needed my friends and ventilate myself, I went to Luna to kind of apologize and told her some things about what had happened with GF, she told me that regardless of what happened she was still my friend and for that reason she would respect the decisions I made, that made me cry because it felt very good that someone respected my will.\n\nLong story short, came back with GF, with the condition she also started going to therapy, we agreed that my limits would be respected, some time passed and now Luna is getting married in a few months, she sent me a wedding invitation for one person and I totally understood that decision, when I told GF about the situation, she got really upset because she says that it's disrespectful towards her and towards me that they do not invite a SO regardless of what happened.\n\nWe ended up fighting about the invitation to a wedding that she \"doesn't even want to go in the first place\" (quote from her) but because she wasn't invited now she wants me to ask for a +1 because if not I'm not giving her \"her place\" as my GF, the other option she is giving me is to not go to the wedding of my best friend that way she would also feel that I am giving her \"her place\" as my GF.\n\nShe told me her friends say that I'm wrong for not asking for an invitation for her because it's not about whether she wants to go or not, it's about the place that I give her as my girlfriend, and I'm confused as hell I think they don't have all the context in this situation and GF says I'm in defense mode for all the past but I'm just respecting Luna's decision.\n\n**TL;DR** GF never liked the relationship I have with my best friend, GF tried to distance me from her and other friends, we broke up, I told my best friend in a venting moment, came back to GF, now my best friend is getting married and she wants just me at the wedding that day, GF says that it is disrespectful towards me and towards her to not invite a SO regardless of the situation, I don't feel the same.",

This was a good compromise for me bc I have sensory issues and touching wet dishes is difficult. \n\nI had to constantly remind her to do them, as the sink would overflow before she would do it. So after having a talk she agreed to set a notification and every two days she would do it. But she never did it ‘every two days’ as she had said she would and I would have to remind her.\n\nAfter a week or so I had another talk with her about how I felt awful everytime I had to remind her, since I could tell she didn’t want to do it and she would get upset when I did tell her. Then we got to talking about how she doesn’t really use dishes, she only eats one meal at home since she works most days and even when she’s not working she would rather just heat up something in the microwave. She uses paper plates and plastic cups and even plastic utensils sometimes. So we decided that I would do the dishes. \n\nThe thing is, she’s a very messy person, and I am too, but I would say my messy is more disorganized and her messy is more leaving food and trash around. The kitchen and living area (places I clean) often have wrappers and random drops of food after she is there. While I try to always keep the bathroom clean after I use it. \n\nShe said that instead of doing the dishes, she could do something else and I recommended sweeping the house especially since i always take my shoes off before i walk into the house and she does not. However it’s been about a week since we agreed to that and she has not done it. I don’t want to remind her, or do it myself since i feel like she needs to contribute if she’s living here. \n\nI feel a lot of resentment towards her, when it feels like i’m doing all the house work, and it’s a daily thing for me and she’s only doing one room, every two weeks-ish. How do I talk to her about my resentment and also the fact that she doesn’t contribute as much as I do? \n\ntldr: my roommate agreed to the dishes and yet she doesn’t use a lot of dishes so i had to remind her to do them and so instead she agreed to sweep the house and yet she isn’t doing that either",

  "body": "I (f22) started talking to now boyfriend (m29) at the beginning of December 2022, everything was going well. We finally met up and hung out for the first time just before new years. Before he and I had sex I was a virgin (and I knew he was not) we had sex three times in 12 hours the night I had met him. This led me to believe that he was finding me attractive or so I thought. \n\nHe planned our first real date which was on New Year's which ended in us having sex again less than a week later. I have never been under the impression the sex was not good, he finished every single time up until this point. Weeks go by and he continues to plan thoughtful dates, some really expensive ones too. We begin to spend more and more time as this January (2023) goes by, but the sex becomes few and far between. What was once also twice a day or at least once every time we saw each other (2-4 times a week), became less than once a week and even fewer than that. All the while we still continue to go on dates and get to know each other. \n\nWhen I had mentioned to him that I felt like we were not having sex much and I wanted that, he quickly explained he was really stressed with work and that he could not get his mind off of it, which made him feel as if he forced it he would not finish nor enjoy sex and how that was not fair to me. I accepted this and felt closer to him, as he opened up. But now as the weeks continue to go by nothing has changed he is still stressed with work. We are not going on as extravagant of dates and they are more casual, but he is still initiating all of them and planning them. He continues to tell me he loves spending time with me and is falling in love with me. He is still actively inviting me over to come to sleep and/ or spend time at his place. We have a TV show we like watching together and we talk and laugh so much!! \n\nPart of me wants to believe that he truly is just overwhelmed and stressed with work and I know he is, but I am new to the \"sex world\" I would like to think sex would take someone's mind off of a stressful work day. When I ask friends (guys and girls) they immediately assume and say that he must be gay. I never wanted to believe this because when we are intimate he always wants the lights on and to be able to look at my face and see me and look into my eyes. I have come to find out per the internet and through hearing about my friends (f 22-26) it sounds like we have very intimate sex (i have never had sex before this, so all I know. )\n\nI have taken into account that because I have only just discovered sex this means I have a strong desire to continue to have sex, but I am unsure why he can't get into the mood more than once a week. We don't really even make out or do anything besides the occasional peck. We cuddle all the time and find a lot of comfort in each other's embrace. \n\nI will add here that last night we were playing a game to get to know each other better (a literal card game), and I got a card that made me ask him to \"admit something\" which he then said and I quote \"I took some dick pills before we started this so I could try and fuck you tonight\" (he was slightly drunk and usually does not talk like that.) He has had trouble in the past staying hard or getting hard which just made me think he was not that into me. It didn't cross my mind that at 29 he could have ED issues. \n\nHe mentioned to me recently that I have been making him feel guilty for not being in the mood to have sex and that it makes me not want to have sex even more because he feels guilty. I apologized because my intentions are never to make him feel guilty or ashamed. I only ever want him to feel loved, wanted, and accepted. I realized at that moment that maybe I had been pushing it too hard or mentioning it in a not kind way. I apologized and made sure he knew that I never wanted him to feel guilty as much as I just wanted him to know where I stood about it all. I told him, that his not being in the mood or not having sex more often made me feel bad and like he was not attracted to me even though he has told me multiple times this is not the case. He then said that my feeling that way was on me because we had talked about it numerous times at this point and he had assured me it was not my fault. \n\nMy heart says it does not just work, but I have considered that he was cheating and I am around way too much, and he just moved to the area in late December around the time I had just met him. I also don't believe he would continue to actively pursue me if he was having sex with someone else and it was better than why keep me around? I really like him and we do refer to each other as our Girlfriend/boyfriend, I am even about to meet his family very soon. \n\nAm I being over the top and reading way too into this? How could someone continue to pursue me and not be able to keep it up, the once a week we try and have sex? Is he not attracted to me? Or does he have ED problems that he does not want to outright come out and say to me? Why would he continue to get to know me and show all the signs of what a healthy relationship is but not want to have sex?  I'm so confused and feeling like I'm going insane trying to figure this out... someone help.",

Wants to be healthier. \n\nFirst week was hard, but i supported her we would go the gym together. Then something clicked and she started to feel the rush. \n\nFor the last 3 weeks she is going for a workout or exercise roughly 3 times a day now. She goes for an 1-2 hours before work for a light workout, then at lunch she does hot Yoga or cardio. Finally after work she goes for around 2-3 hours. \n\nShe is not training for anything, when people ask her what her goals are she just wants to feel healthy. I have told her she is over doing it, her exercise coach at the gym dropped her because she kept refusing to follow his exercise plans and kept overdoing everything. \n\nShe is constantly angry and upset, all she does is she complains she is exhausted and she is sore. When she comes home from work, she inhales whatever i have cooked. Then pretty much goes to sleep. Leaving everything to me. She is constantly battling one sickness to the next. \n\nEvery time i try to talk to her about this she gets extremely angry. I work full time as well and it basically feels like I am a single parent. \n\nTonight we were supposed to drive up to her parents with our daughter, she suddenly refused because she wouldn't be able to go to the gym as she has to follow her workout. Instead she wanted me to drive 4 hours with our daughters to go see her parents. While she would work out all weekend or something? I don't know. \n\nIf she wont listen to me what can i do?\n\n*Update* I tried to have a long talk with her today and she got extremely angry and upset with me before leaving. I ended up talking to her parents as well who were really confused by her behavior. \n\nShe is actually going to the gym constantly, and I am trying to schedule something next week for her to meet with an addiction specialist.",

I have told her she is over doing it, her exercise coach at the gym dropped her because she kept refusing to follow his exercise plans and kept overdoing everything. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is constantly angry and upset, all she does is she complains she is exhausted and she is sore. When she comes home from work, she inhales whatever i have cooked. Then pretty much goes to sleep. Leaving everything to me. She is constantly battling one sickness to the next. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time i try to talk to her about this she gets extremely angry. I work full time as well and it basically feels like I am a single parent. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tonight we were supposed to drive up to her parents with our daughter, she suddenly refused because she wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to go to the gym as she has to follow her workout. Instead she wanted me to drive 4 hours with our daughters to go see her parents. While she would work out all weekend or something? I don&amp;#39;t know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she wont listen to me what can i do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt; I tried to have a long talk with her today and she got extremely angry and upset with me before leaving. I ended up talking to her parents as well who were really confused by her behavior. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She is actually going to the gym constantly, and I am trying to schedule something next week for her to meet with an addiction specialist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "(update below original post)\n\nBackground: \n\nI have a married friend, let's call him Bob, who I have known for about 4 years. Bob is my cousin's best friend. He knew my gf before I met her, but they were never close, just acquainted. Bob cheats on his wife religiously, which I really do not like; I tolerate him because of my cousin. He has sent inappropriate text messages to my gf on a few occasions, and I have told him that we don't appreciate it. Bob's wife was out of town the weekend of the following event. \n\nEdit:\n- Bob has gf's number because gf's daughter worked at his restaurant.\n- I have not personally observed Bob cheating on his wife. I have been told by my cousin that \"Bob is out here banging women like he's single.\" I don't question it, because why would my cousin lie about that. \n\nThe event in question:\n\nI met up with a bunch of friends to go out for my birthday. Bob asked where my gf was; I told him that she stayed home, and we would go out alone the following day. He said \"cool, I'm going out with some old friends tonight, but I'll meet up with you guys after.\" He never met up with us; no big deal.\n\nThe next day, I took my gf out to dinner. We were talking, and she asked if Bob was drunk last night. I said \"probably, but I don't know. He went out with some old friends.\" She then showed me text messages that he sent her -- most of them were just stupid banter, but there were two that did not sit well with me. They read:\n\n\"Hey, call me when you're free\"\n\"But only tonight 😉\"\n\nShe didn't respond to him, and he eventually just said \"happy new year.\" She thought Bob went out with me, and we were just messing with her. After I told her that he didn't, she felt very uncomfortable about these messages. She also was not aware that Bob's wife was out of town that weekend.\n\nI texted Bob, \"Hey Bob, I think there has been a misunderstanding. I would like to remind you that [gf] is my girlfriend, and we are exclusive. This is the last time I'm going to say this.\" Bob responded, \"Good for you guys, but I don't know why you're telling me this.\" About a minute later, he sent another message, \"I don't need this drama. I'm going to block you both. You guys need to get your story straight before you come at me.\" This response bothered me; this told me that he knew exactly why I was messaging him, and he knew it was dirty. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Bob sent another text to my gf -- \"what did you tell [me]?\" My gf did not respond, and she blocked his number and social media accounts. \n\nBob told my cousin something about this event, I'm not sure what and don't really care. He's my cousin's friend and I don't want to interfere with their relationship, but I did show him the messages and told him that Bob crossed a line. My cousin is trying to maintain both relationships, so he is trying to convince me that it isn't what it seems. He told me that he thinks my gf is trying to emotionally manipulate me because she doesn't like Bob. \n\nTo me, it looks like Bob tried to take advantage of the fact that his wife was out of town and my gf was alone. I am convinced, based on the circumstances, that he would have slept with my gf had she been willing. Am I being insecure/ overreacting? Does this just seem like innocent banter, or do you think I'm making the right call?\n\n\n**********[UPDATE]**********\n\nBefore I begin, I would just like to reiterate how much I appreciate everyone's input on my original post. You all took the time to give me your opinions, and I want you all to know that I heard and felt that, even if I seemed resistant to some suggestions, and even if we didn't see eye to eye. The community rules only allow for one update, so I suppose this will be the last one on this topic... If anyone is interested in the ultimate outcome, feel free to message me. \n\nI had another conversation with my cousin, and had a very long conversation with my gf about this. I did not mention anything about a reddit post, or consensus on how I should proceed... That's not really my style. \n\nWhat I did do is warn my cousin that I'm considering telling his wife about this, and advised him to distance himself from Bob for the sake of his own marriage. I said \"I don't know what you guys do together, and I would hate for your wife to associate you with cheating if you've done nothing.\" He says he will, but I don't believe him. What he does at this point is on his shoulders, not mine. \n\nAfter discussing at length the pros and cons of telling his wife with my gf, we have decided that we should probably tell her. Neither of us wants to do it, but my gf believes that it should be her that breaks the news. They are both from the same country, and have a lot of cultural similarities; she is also the one who was approached and harassed by Bob. Our hope is that the news will be better received and understood coming from her. I will be present, but solely for her safety. \n\nI have not spoken to my father about this yet, but I plan to. I don't want to create any extra drama, but feel like there will be some bullshit coming out of this and he should probably have a heads up. \n\nTL; DR, we all know that Bob is a giant piece of shit. You guys told me that I should tell his wife, and I heard you. His wife will know soon.",

Where she would start trying to grab me by the balls or try putting her fingers up my ass (over the clothes) just to mess with me. \n\nNormally it's fine and a bit annoying but it's just how she is. but last night, When I was in bed trying to go asleep she came up the stairs and got into bed behind me.( I go to bed earlier then her because im up earlier for work) i was turned around she came behind me and tried getting me to turn around to cuddle her. I was near asleep so I didn't. Then she started the playing messing tiggeling, poking and pinching. And when that didn't work she grabbed me by the boxers and just started pulling them up my ass very forcefully to the point it really hurt. So I said stop a couple of times and readjusted myself. Then it just kept escalating and getting more painful. I kept saying stop and at some point I started crying. Then I could hear my boxers start ripping and it hurt really bad. Eventually it hurt so much that I stood up out of the bed and started shouting for her to stop and why is she tormenting me. To which she just turned around and ignored me. \n\nI stayed up for a couple of hours after to make sure she was asleep before I went to sleep and cried a little more. The next morning I was trying to poo and it just hurt I realised that she pulled so hard the she actually cut me on my ring and it was bleeding a fair bit. \n\nI sat her down when I got home from work and nearly in tears I told her how much she hurt me and its getting pretty regular that she gets out of hand play messing and I see what she did last night as the worst thing she's ever done to me. And I view it as sexual assault. She listened for a bit and said I was right about everything and I had a point but she's very upset I called it sexual assault as that's a terrible thing to accuse her of. \n\nI said I view sexual assault as any unwanted physical attention to a private area especially when painful and I said stop multiple times and I just feel so violated after it. \n\nI know in the grand scale of things it was pretty low on the list of things that are called sexual assault but I still feel so demeaned and violated. \n\nI hope no one that has been a victim of sexual assault is offended by my statement I know that there are many worse forms of it. But I feel like she thinks because I'm a man it's not valid. \n\nBut I don't know what to do, I know she doesn't want to hurt me she's just really strong and it gets a bit out of hand. But I feel how I feel. \n\nAny answers or advice is welcome.",

  "body": "I (24M) and my best friend (28F) have known each other for about a year now. We met at work and eventually became friends and began hanging out outside of work. I’ve only recently started developing feelings for her and I don’t know what to do. I’m going crazy about her, constantly thinking about her, going out of my way at work to talk to her, getting excited when she texts me, etc. There’s strong chemistry there to me, but I guess she doesn’t feel the same or she just doesn’t let her mind go there. \n\nShe has expressed how she wouldn’t feel comfortable dating someone she works closely with because that could complicate things, and she’s also noted how she doesn’t see herself dating someone younger than her. I should add that at work, she’s technically my boss (not my direct manager, but in the position as my manager) so that would only further complicate things. Because we’re friends, she’s constantly telling me about her dating life and stuff she’s doing with other guys and it just makes me feel miserable. \n\nI wish that I could distance myself from her altogether, and only talk to her about work related stuff, but I moved to this city for work and she’s one of the only outside-of-work friends I’ve made since moving here. I’ve tried distancing myself from her at work as much as possible, and not hanging out one-on-one anymore, but I don’t know how to do that. She will invite me out to dinner and over to watch a tv show we both like, and I instinctively jump at the chance. So it’s either continue hanging out with her knowing it won’t go any further and be miserable, or spend everyday away from work alone and be miserable.  \n\nWhat’s the best thing to do here? Should I just keep trying to shove my feelings down?",

We met at work and eventually became friends and began hanging out outside of work. I’ve only recently started developing feelings for her and I don’t know what to do. I’m going crazy about her, constantly thinking about her, going out of my way at work to talk to her, getting excited when she texts me, etc. There’s strong chemistry there to me, but I guess she doesn’t feel the same or she just doesn’t let her mind go there. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She has expressed how she wouldn’t feel comfortable dating someone she works closely with because that could complicate things, and she’s also noted how she doesn’t see herself dating someone younger than her. I should add that at work, she’s technically my boss (not my direct manager, but in the position as my manager) so that would only further complicate things. Because we’re friends, she’s constantly telling me about her dating life and stuff she’s doing with other guys and it just makes me feel miserable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wish that I could distance myself from her altogether, and only talk to her about work related stuff, but I moved to this city for work and she’s one of the only outside-of-work friends I’ve made since moving here. I’ve tried distancing myself from her at work as much as possible, and not hanging out one-on-one anymore, but I don’t know how to do that. She will invite me out to dinner and over to watch a tv show we both like, and I instinctively jump at the chance. So it’s either continue hanging out with her knowing it won’t go any further and be miserable, or spend everyday away from work alone and be miserable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What’s the best thing to do here? Should I just keep trying to shove my feelings down?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "Hi everyone, I’m(30M) being puzzle since a couple of months, I’m gonna try  to summarise in a nutshell the history with my partner (32F).\n\nI   moved countries because I got a job, a couple of months later I met  her  and everything was good, after one year and a couple of months we  moved  together because I got laid off. At that time i was scared that  my money  wouldn’t last and i needed to move back to my country, that  was one of  the reasons why I moved. It my first time sharing an  apartment with a  partner. Since I met her she had a excellent salary  and today i made my  way up in a new job and we are both earning the  same amount. So let’s  say that money is not a problem anymore.\n\nNow   it’s been 3 years together, and I have seen some red flags in our   relationship. Once we discussed about children (I don’t want, she   wanted) then she shifted from wanting to “let’s see in the future”. She   wants to get married and for my is a waste of money and don’t find it   necessary.\n\nOn top of those topics,   which are not tiny, I’ve been felling a lacking of freedom in our   relationship. It’s really difficult for me to say “No” to her. A couple   of times I did it and ended up in a mess (she crying because I didn’t   wanna do what she wanted). One clear example, I’m playing soccer in the   team of the city. One Saturday the team was playing and I was injured,   nevertheless I went there to support the team while my GF was working  on  the house she bought and is renovating. The day before we were  talking  and I said to her that i needed to go because I needed to pull  the plug  for one Saturday (were a lot of weekends in a row that I was  helping her  with her house). The day of the match she called me crying  that I  should be there with her helping and not supporting my team,  that she  can’t do everything alone. After a couple of hours when I came  back home  feeling guilty for taking my time (actually i couldn’t enjoy  the match  because I was thinking about the situation all the time) we  had a long  talk about how she needs my support and I explained her that  I need my  moments of disconnection. She kinda agree. There more  examples but don’t  want to enumerate all of them.\n\nSomehow   I have the feeling if I don’t do what she wants there is going to be a   problem. I was thinking about ending up the relationship but at the  same  time i feel guilty because I will not support her anymore, she has  a  loan to pay, and she is scared of not being able to pay all the  bills  (she has savings, cars and a family that can support her with  money but  she doesn’t want to owe money to anybody she is scared of not  being  economically independent). On the rational side of my mind I  know she  has enough support from other, friends, family, etc. and I  only have a  couple of new friends in this country.\n\nLast   but not least, she already planned the entire life together with me.   she always mentions that I’m the best partner she ever had that I’m   kind, we can have long and deep conversations, I’m supportive and easy   going, etc. She had bad experiences with previous relationships and I   feel guilty just thinking about how broken she could be if I break up   with her but I got to a point that there are moments that a simple   comment/action coming from her annoys incredibly.\n\nThe   last days we haven’t shared too much time together because of work   going to the office, and I’m really happy to be alone in the flat. I   feel the freedom back.\n\nI truly   don’t know what to do, I somehow feel responsible for her emotions, and I   know it’s not okay. But i think I’ve developed a certain level of   emotional dependency with her, i refrain from doing activities that i   like to not hurt her feelings. I think this post is a bit venting a bit   looking for new perspectives.\n\nAny advice? Comments?  I'd like your opinions Thanks for reading,  sorry for any grammar mistake.\n\nTLDR: I think I’m in a toxic relationship with some flavors of emotional dependency and idk what to do",

  "body": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. I’ve never loved someone as much as I’ve loved this man. He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7-8 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I knew that I wanted to break it off for him for a little while and kept pushing it off. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality and a million other things at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. I wasn’t seeking a relationship nor really anything else. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I don’t remember what our original conversation was about. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. I feel like if I don’t tell him how, then I’m lying to him or that if I brought it up one day he’ll think it’s worse than what it was or maybe even that I hide things from him. I had honest to god forgotten about this event because I I really didn’t like her and it was just some stupid attention thing. Someone brought up her name last month and now I literally can’t stop thinking about it. I go to bed thinking about it, I wake up thinking about, I’ve cried thinking about it.\n\nMy therapist said that this sounds like a normal teenage thing to do and that I need to learn to control my obsessive thoughts but I feel like this is different. I feel like if I don’t tell him then I’m keeping it a secret. We’ve been dating now for 4 years and I feel like I owe him the honesty. Everyone else has told me to move past it, and that telling him would just hurt his feelings and maybe even make him question me for still thinking about it 4 years later.\n\nDo I tell him for honesty sake or do I keep it to myself? Should I feel as shitty as I do or was this just a mistake in my past? Everyone is telling me the opposite of what my brain is feeling. Maybe this is just karma for being such a shitty girl friend in the beginning.",

After 5 minutes I open the door and no one&amp;#39;s there so I use it. Then after another 5 minutes I go look for them and I hear sex sounds upstairs. Her sex sounds. But I think maybe she&amp;#39;s up in the other toilet upstairs and he woke up his gf and got it. I go back downstairs. After another 5 I go back up and open the door. The room is dark and he pulls his pants up and she hides behind the door I just open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I go back downstairs. Go to the other guy at the table and say I&amp;#39;m leaving then I go to the other room, grab my bag and then go outside to my car and drive home about 2km away. When she gets home she&amp;#39;s crying saying she didn&amp;#39;t remember and then I say tomorrow we need to sort out belongings but she leaves then and stays at another friend&amp;#39;s place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning I get texts saying they were doing lines and then he needed to piss so turned the light off to protect his modesty and she says she didn&amp;#39;t have sex and her clothes were on and she wishes she didn&amp;#39;t hide behind the door. The next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of that she tries to say she followed me but I had gone except I made like 3 stops to say bye to the other guy and grab my things so they didn&amp;#39;t chase me down straight away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They don&amp;#39;t address her sex sounds which I know, they&amp;#39;re distinctive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;re definitely lying right? Am I being gaslit? It doesn&amp;#39;t take that long to do a line and piss and sex sounds&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

When I've brought this to his attention previously he would tell me that's his humor, and/or he thinks victim blaming is funny (example: there was a TikTok that popped up on my page that was a jubilee video of people reading people's anonymous notes out loud (cheating related) and one of the notes that was read was: \"being cheated on changes perceptions of yourself, years later I still find myself wondering what she had that I didn't and why I'll never be good enough\", my boyfriends comment under the video was \"that is correct - if you got cheated on its your fault\"). I asked him what was his mindset with making that comment, and that its hard for me to build trust when I continue to see things like that from him, that's when he said he thinks victim blaming is funny, I responded with \"I don't joke with peoples emotions\", and he responded \"I will definitely joke about peoples emotions if idc about them, the way people like to post affirmation, I like to share stuff and caption it with anti affirmation\", I responded with I told you before what I needed from you in order to built trust with you\", and he said \"why am I always explaining myself to you\". I said to him \"seeing repost shares or engagement with stuff you know I'm eventually gonna see despite your target audience, you're explaining yourself continuously because you're ignoring something I'm expressing I need, I wouldn't bring this up otherwise\". He said \"You need me to not be myself\", and I said \"I'm willing to change things about myself especially if it's hurting someone I care about. I expect you to do the same.\" anddddddd then he said \"Okay, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThat was just one example of times when he would engage with stuff on social media where I feel like I can't trust him, this most recent time is him sharing a post on Facebook of someone's that reads: \"no Facebook I don't want to add the girl I got cheated on with thank you.\", and his share response was: \"Why you mad her? You got your priorities figured out huh\". I'm not sure what he's implying by his response to that post but I feel like a broken record repeating myself that I have trust issues whenever he engages with cheating related posts. I'm not really sure the best course of action is. This relationship matters to me a lot, but also I'm starting to have really bad trust issues.",

I asked him what was his mindset with making that comment, and that its hard for me to build trust when I continue to see things like that from him, that&amp;#39;s when he said he thinks victim blaming is funny, I responded with &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t joke with peoples emotions&amp;quot;, and he responded &amp;quot;I will definitely joke about peoples emotions if idc about them, the way people like to post affirmation, I like to share stuff and caption it with anti affirmation&amp;quot;, I responded with I told you before what I needed from you in order to built trust with you&amp;quot;, and he said &amp;quot;why am I always explaining myself to you&amp;quot;. I said to him &amp;quot;seeing repost shares or engagement with stuff you know I&amp;#39;m eventually gonna see despite your target audience, you&amp;#39;re explaining yourself continuously because you&amp;#39;re ignoring something I&amp;#39;m expressing I need, I wouldn&amp;#39;t bring this up otherwise&amp;quot;. He said &amp;quot;You need me to not be myself&amp;quot;, and I said &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m willing to change things about myself especially if it&amp;#39;s hurting someone I care about. I expect you to do the same.&amp;quot; anddddddd then he said &amp;quot;Okay, I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was just one example of times when he would engage with stuff on social media where I feel like I can&amp;#39;t trust him, this most recent time is him sharing a post on Facebook of someone&amp;#39;s that reads: &amp;quot;no Facebook I don&amp;#39;t want to add the girl I got cheated on with thank you.&amp;quot;, and his share response was: &amp;quot;Why you mad her? You got your priorities figured out huh&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;m not sure what he&amp;#39;s implying by his response to that post but I feel like a broken record repeating myself that I have trust issues whenever he engages with cheating related posts. I&amp;#39;m not really sure the best course of action is. This relationship matters to me a lot, but also I&amp;#39;m starting to have really bad trust issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We’ve had our ups and downs, but would absolutely be described as a happy and loving couple and most times we’d live up.\n\nMy wife is an ultra talented creative, but has struggled in the past thrusting herself into it as a career. I understand this and try to keep my distance (although I’m guilty of excitedly spouting out unsolicited advice at times) This summer she spoke with me about leaving her job to pursue a career as a creative full time. I supported her because of how talented she is (she’s received some recognition for her work and has been told numerous times to pursue it full time by people in the field) She left her job and a week later my health went down the tubes.\n\nLuckily I’m not in any serious danger, but I’ve been dealing with these issues since July. Back in autumn I  had to have a procedure that’s kind of left me tethered to a piece of medical equipment (hoping they remove it in a few weeks) but it’s cut down on my mobility, ability to work, and overall happiness and attitude.\n\nHere’s the problem: My wife hasn’t actively pursued her career as a creative since quitting. She offered to get a job before my procedure to help out (I’m still getting paid, money isn’t an issue) She got one, but felt the particular job was too stressful for the moment (it was) so she quit. At the time of quitting she said she’d eventually look for another job, that was early December.\n\nShe’s been “taking care of me” mostly keeping me company and doing most of the house work. I still do laundry, I don’t like that I’m in bad shape and want to help, but I am limited. I’m also really cranky and don’t pretend not to be. Over the last few weeks her attitude and priorities don’t quite line up with what we had discussed. (She was pushing for a move to a different part of the country, so it was time to save) I’ve tried to encourage her to either go work at her desk or look for a job gently through out this time period. She’s been more focused on gaming and exploring the possibility that she may have psychic powers (?) The last 48 hours she started giving me a lot of attitude about little things around the house (I never put the drain in the sink, I left my medical tape around again, etc.)\n\nToday I kind of lost it and told her that she was the problem. That she’s spending too much time around the house and needs to worry less about minor details of my day and more about what she needs to do with her life.\n\nIt became a big fight and me and my medical apparatus are friggin in my parents basement.\n\nI said some mean thing (we both did, but mostly me) so I don’t mind giving her space, I just wonder if I’m wrong for how I feel about the situation in general.\n\nShe’s always been a great partner in the past, and she’s helped me through this in a lot of other ways. I just feel a bit abandoned by her actions in this regard and am frustrated by her scrutinizing.",

Maybe it is time for you to take on more responsibilities. But you’ve gone about addressing that all wrong. Instead of acknowledging the effort she’s been putting in, you’ve dismissed it. Instead of having an open conversation about whether you’re BOTH ready for this dynamic to change, and what that will look like, you’ve tried to unilaterally decide. And you resent her for not just being totally okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not surprised this became a big fight. She likely feels completely taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "body": "We got married quickly; 6 months into dating and we've been married and living together for a year and a half. Part of the reason was because she lived in another country and I didn't think long distance would work. I fell for her quickly and deeply; it felt like magic. She's beautiful, funny, and smart. I knew her moving to my country and in with me would a challenge, and most things we've worked through. There's one issue that persists; compromise.\n\nShe's extremely picky and unwilling to compromise. She draws hard lines in the sand and gets upset if I suggest something that’s outside of that. She beats down suggestions that she doesn’t like. “Why would we watch _____ during dinner?” “You know I don’t like that; why would you say that?” “Here’s the reason that’s bad and you shouldn’t have suggested it.” This applies to the small and big things; food we eat, videogames we play, shows we watch, what we buy, where we live, our schedule. We’ve had many talks about these issues individually, which generally comes down to her explaining why her preference is what it is, and why that’s our best option. She agreed to say no more gently, but doesn’t agree that she could be more flexible. She says she shouldn’t have to watch / play / do something she doesn’t want to.\n\nThe big issue right now is that also applies to where we live. She’s only willing to live in Toronto or Vancouver, and not for a career reason. She’s still figuring out her career, and so I’m paying 80% of the bills. I got a good job offer (+$10k) in a smaller city (population 500,000) that’s an hour from Toronto and she said there’s no way she’d live there. She says I don’t consider her if I suggest something she doesn’t want. She says “we decided”, and “we want” as if we decided on something equally, but many times what I want isn’t welcome at the table of decision making. We decide between the the things that she wants and at the end she feels like we had equal say. She does ask for my opinion on things daily, but I feel like my choice is between yes and an argument. I find myself suggesting only what I know she likes and pushing down my wants.\n\nMy dad asked me to play a couple games of chess so I said to her “Do you mind if I play a couple games of chess with my dad after dinner?” I played for an hour and she was upset with me. My best friend made a comment that we only hang out when she’s busy, and he’s right. I don’t feel like I can just hop on a videogame with him when she’s here without her getting upset. I’m flexible so it wasn’t a big deal at first, but I’ve been feeling an increasing anxiety and constriction. I knew that I would lose some autonomy with marriage, but this feels like a lot. I find myself sitting in my car after work and looking forward to time she has planned with friends.\n\nI want to live in a place that has a reasonable cost of living. I want to see my family more. I want to play the videogames I like. I want to watch documentaries. I want to get back into photography. I want to feel like I can just do something because I feel like doing it. My friend said I should just do those things, and be ok with her getting upset. Should I just brute force this thing? I want to make this work; I really love her.\n\nTLDR: My wife is picky and not willing to compromise. I feel like I’m losing autonomy and conversations with her haven’t improved the situation much.",

I'm devastated and I have never posted anything on reddit.\n\nMy bf and I have been dating for almost a year, we met through a dating app and it was a long distance relationship. We are Persians (in case it matters). Almost 3 months into our relationship, I found out that he was cheating on me with a Mexican girl. I forgave him as he told me that she was from a different country and would never marry her and he swore that he left her. In turns out he told her that he left me (so basically continued using her for sex). We both believed this liar! He continued sleeping with her and eventually he run away from her. She called me and told me that they were still together and were sleeping for another 2 months. After giving him a second chance, he moved in with me for a month. We lived together happily ever after, despite always having doubts that he was talking to others.\n\nHe moves to a different state for a job, Ohio and his ex gf calls him and cries because he left her and run away from her. He keeps talking to her behind my back and buys her a ticket to come visit him. I find out about it and he tells the ex gf not to come and blocks her. She still desperately shows up and stays with him for a week- despite, me calling his friend and all 4 of us having a big fight and me telling him to kick her out and he claimed it was 2 AM and he was gonna sleep on the couch and would kick her out the following day. I got super angry and changed my phone number. He was GONE for a week as she refused to leave his place and wanted to leave on her original flight day. Once she left, he kept emailing me and I forgave him again!\n\nI forgave him like a fool, a month later we find out the ex gf is pregnant (she removed her IUD and didn't tell him). I found out and I still stayed with him because I loved him to death and he was never going to be with her as she has 2 older children from different men and he refused to be involved in this child's or her life. She decided to keep the baby.\n\nWe have been having fights for the last 4-5 months because I remind him on daily basis that he cheated on me and remind him of her..... The reason I'm reaching out is because I need some support and few encouraging words..... WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n\nPS: I'm 25+ and attractive with plenty of men wanting me, also I'm graduating from top medical school with an MD.\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH!",

  "body": "Does this count as a relationship?\n\nHello!! I'm currently 19 (F) and I'm a lesbian. I've never been a relationship before and don't have any romantic experience whatsoever. \nHalf a year ago, I started messaging someone on reddit, a women whos 24. We quickly switched to messaging each other on WhatsApp and we've talked almost every day for the past 6 months. \nA month ago, we confessed that we both like each other. The relationship is long distance, I'm in England and she is in Norway, but she has said that she has family in England and has visited and stayed for holidays before. \n\nI guess, because I've never been in a relationship and all the ones I've seen, watched or read about include physical contact like hugs and stuff, a part of me feels like this isn't a \"real\" realtionship. But then I was thinking about it more thoroughly and was wondering if I'd still feel like this if this was a boy I was in a LD relationship? Maybe it's internalised homophobia?\n\nAnother thing is, I'm extremely introverted and don't have any friends. I talk occasionally to my coworkers. One coworker mentioned it was weird that I was 19 and she was 5, almost 6 years, older than me. I never thought it was weird because the age difference never affected any of our conversations but my coworker just thought it was weird with the age difference, combined with the fact that we met online. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for any advice? Or opinions? \nThank you!",

Today is my first day back to work since vacation and I noticed he was still logged into his Snapchat on my phone. \n\nHe mainly uses Snapchat to talk to a female friend of his, he’s know 8 years. He also uses it to talk to me when I’m working. \n\nAll his Snapchat conversations are saved on there and I decided to look through them. I feel bad looking but this is what I saw..\n\nBack in May he told his friend on Snapchat how he hooked up with the girl and how that never happens and how crazy it was.. \n\nI’m so upset and don’t know how to handle this situation. Back in June when we moved in together I went through his phone and saw these messages (from May) between him and this woman. The messages were extremely flirty, I ended up texting the woman and asking if they hooked up. She said they did.\n\nHe swore it was an old message from before we dated and that she was lying because the message in his phone didn’t have a date on it. \n\nI unfortunately believed him. Since then I haven’t looked through his stuff and have trusted him.\n\nNow I know he hooked up with her and I’m disgusted. He also said in this conversation back in October how he wasn’t attracted to me anymore and was asking this female friend he was talking to if she would sleep with him. \n\nI don’t want to be in this relationship anymore. I feel sick, I feel dirty and betrayed and stupid. I feel embarrassed since he was just on a family trip with me.. \n\nI don’t know how to approach this since we live together, he is broke and has a minimum wage job. We live in a townhouse that I am the property manager of so I can’t move out.\n\nHe will try and deny it and then distract me with the fact that I went though his messages.

  "body": "I (F25) think I'm in a casual relationship but he (M32) confuses me and won't talk about it. What do I do? Help me, I'm losing it.\n\nTwo months ago, I went on a date with a guy I see almost everyday. We work close to each other.  We've met for Netflix and chill 3 more times \n\nWe went on a walk, early afternoon (he insisted on that) , walked for 5 hours talking, we had dinner afterwards, took me home and... things escalated quickly, we had sex (I initiated it, it 100% wouldn't happen otherwise). He said a lot of shit about us being in a relationship in the future (fucking weird ik, first date ). I told him that I don't want anyone to know shit in my workplace and we agreed on being extremely secretive no matter what. \n\nFrom what I know, he has a bad reputation, he stays with a girl for less than a month and then dissappears. Knowing that, I can't trust his ass so I expect nothing, I'M MORE THAN FINE with a casual relationship . My friends say I'm stupid that I can't see that he wants more than a casual relationship , I just turn him down too much. Some said that I'll be the one hurting him so I have to walk away. I believe he's just PLAYING because he's a player. Also most of the things he says don't make sense. \nThe signs:\n - First of all, I'm the only girl he went on an actual date, for a walk in 5 years. He also has asked on multiple occasions if I talk to other people just to see where this is going. \n- I told him I don't trust him so I can't be trusted either, I have a bad reputation of ghosting and I can easily dissappear. He was really offended, but at last he agreed that he can't be trusted. He also said that he never asked me to be trustworthy but saying that I'm not isn't ok. \n-He never fucking gets out of his house , he has an extreme schedule and follows it to the T. Works a lot and does the same 3 things all week. I'm an addition to his schedule, I can bend it somehow , he will say yes no matter the day. He picks me up and we talk and watch a movie, sex, finishing the movie and gossip for 3 hours. It's a five hour interaction every time. He is extremely cute, does the absolute most to take care of me, kisses me a lot, hugs me more. He cuddles with me. He said he hasn't slept with another person in years, he doesn't cuddle, he said . He cuddles with me, won't let me leave in the morning because he wants me to stay a little longer .He got our of bed and RUN to me just to kiss me before I left in the morning, he fucking complained that I didn't kiss him goodbye before leaving . He won't initiate dates though, it's always a \"come to my place to watch a movie \" 🚩. \n- I have ghosted him, on multiple occasions, not on purpose, I'm the worst texter. He won't care, he will double text, goodmorning texts every day. He takes like 5 hours to answer too though.Unless the conversation is about tea or sex. To me that's a clear sign of a man that isn't that interested🚩. \n - Last week he complained that I never ask if he's ok, I never did even when I knew he was sick, I only care about his dick he said. I answered \"true\".For now caring about him is the wrong thing to do. No matter how many times I've tried to sneakily ask about us he fucking avoids it saying \"it doesn't matter what I want\", \"doesn't matter what I say\". 🚩\n- I told him that our thing isn't serious and he fucking asked if \"I blame him for that too\". What does this even mean.... \nI didn't reply for two days, he texted first again but now he's weirdly cocky, replies less. Pisses me off honestly and I don't know if it's my fault or he's losing interest. \n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like a man that wants more than a casual relationship, would do something about it . Are those signs that he wants more than a sex only relationship or is everyone delusional but me?",

I had “friends” in high school but they were more like guys who I just hung out with to pass time. Jay, however, is different. We have so much in common and I’ve never been able to talk to anyone as easily as I can talk to him. He’s funny, much smarter than me, kinder than I could ever be, and always seems to know what to say no matter the situation. He’s also, objectively, a really attractive guy. He’s way cooler and better than I am, and yet he still spends all his free time with me. I was a bit uneasy starting college because I didn’t have any friends and would be far from home, but it has been amazing almost entirely because of him. In only a year, I started to think of Jay as a true, best friend. \n\nI didn’t know he was gay. He never told me, which is perfectly fine, and he doesn’t “act gay”. But I don’t really think that “acting gay” means anything. I’ve never questioned my sexuality mainly because I’ve never had any real relationships. I dated two girls throughout highschool for less than three months combined…I’m just not a very romance/sex heavy person. It’s never been on the forefront of my mind. Until two days ago, however, when Jay called saying he wanted to have a talk. \n\nI was scared and thought maybe something happened. But he came to my dorm, sat down and came out as gay. To me, at least. He said he knew he was gay since middle school, but tried to hide it because of his parents. I’ve never seen  anything wrong with being gay, I mean it’s just love right? So I obviously told him I support him and thanked him for coming out to me. (I’m still embarrassed because I don’t know if you’re supposed to thank someone for being gay…) He seemed happy at first but then got all upset and told me he was sorry. And confessed that he really, really liked me, romantically (and sexually I guess?) I was shocked, and speechless really. He got very sad and told me that I didn’t have to say anything and that he hoped we could still be friends. Then he left and said he’ll give me some space. We haven’t talked in the two days since and I feel really shitty. \n\nI’ve thought a lot. Too much, really, about him and how he likes me. My problem is that I want to try going out with him, but I don’t want to hurt him if I’m not gay. I’ve never cared about someone as much as I care about Jay, and all I could think about these past two days is how damn depressed I’d be if we stopped hanging out and being close. I think I could love him, and a large part of me wants to try, but I’m also very afraid of what would happen if we started dating and it turns out I didn’t like guys. Because I’m still not sure I do like guys. I can’t see myself with just any random guy. But Jay’s not a random guy, and in every scenario my brain comes up with, Jay’s always there beside me and we’re laughing having fun.  \n\nI need some advice.

He was loving, caring, respectful, generous, and he was always there for me. We used to have a loot of fun together. However, he left in October to take care of his family. He told me his parents are sick and he's the only one of his brothers who can work remotely and stay with them. We were talking all the time and doing long distance. After two months (end of November) he started to get distant. I asked him what's wrong and he said \"there's something that I didn't tell u but my parents are getting a divorce\" and he's feeling awful about it and he disappeared after that for couple of weeks no calls nothing. \nThen he suddenly called me he said he's back and i was so happy, we met and we hang out for two weeks, everything was back to normal. \nThen he left again without a goodbye or anything, he said he's mom called and he has to go. He literally told me this via voice note. And he disappeared again. It's been 6 weeks now no calls nothing. He only sent me two voice notes since he left. He said he's going through a lot and he doesn't want to talk.

I left him bunch of messages saying I love him and I'll wait for him no matter what, he just need to talk to me and not ghost me like this.

  "body": "I feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for his ex best friend\n\nMe (26f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been dating for four years. We have a great relationship usually and we are genuinely each others best friends. But before we began dating he had this girl best friend (27f), they were very close, used to hang out all the time, talk most days and would even share a bed if he stayed over at her place. He admitted to me that he had a crush on her but that she was not interested in him so nothing happened romantically between them.\n\n\nWhen we began dating I was keen to meet her but she was pretty rude towards me during our first interaction and showed no interest which completely threw me off. She would then proceed to invite my boyfriend to lunches and dinners or over to stay at her house and exclude me, which annoyed my boyfriend as he felt it was purposeful and unnecessarily mean of her, so he would try to include me in the plans which would then make her uninterested and the plan wouldn’t go ahead. If we ever were all together in a group setting she would make me feel highly uncomfortable and do things like be very overly touchy feely with him, behaving in a girlfriend-like manner. One time even grabbing his leg under the table and said “we never hang out just us anymore” giving him puppy dog eyes, to which my boyfriend replied to her saying that they can still hang out just with me now also. \n\nSo essentially this sort of behaviour went on for awhile and at this point it’s safe to say I did not like her at all. She failed to be the cool person I thought she might have been and ended up being the stereotypical “girl best friend”. She moved cities so we stopped hearing from her as much and I grateful that my boyfriend respected me and our relationship enough to put boundaries in place with her without me even having to ask.\n\nIt’s been at least 3 years since then and we haven’t heard from her, we only have her on socials so I know she’s in a long term relationship now. But about four months ago I noticed my boyfriend had been liking her selfies which isn’t a common occurrence. So I asked him about it, after some time he said that he’s missing the friendship and is just thinking about old times with her. I tried to be understanding toward him but I also wanted him to understand how that doesn’t particularly make me feel good about myself or secure in the relationship considering he has liked her as more than just a friend before. He said her posts just show up on his feed and that gets him thinking about the past so then he likes the selfie. The topic was then dropped, but I didn’t really feel reassured by him and truly felt maybe it was more than just a friendship he was mourning.\n\nSo then I did something that I probably shouldn’t have, I muted her account on his Instagram so that her posts would no longer show up in the main feed, so that he would stop always seeing what she’s doing and thinking of her so intensely. I know that doing that was a breach of privacy and I shouldn’t have done it in hindsight, but at the time I felt justified to do it as a way to try and halt what was happening and partly to see if he would still go out of his way to react to her posts and stories.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I was using his phone (we use each-others phones for things openly) and I saw there was messages on Instagram between them, nothing that interesting but he had messaged a response to something on her story, she gave a meek reply and eventually left his final message on seen. She seemed fairly disinterested in the convo. Then I check her profile and he’s liking her posts, which means he’s been going out of his way to check up on her, and judging from the story reply it seems he wanted a way to strike up a conversation. \n\nNow it’s really not the conversation or the liking of the posts that is getting to me it’s the lying and the going out of his way to constantly check up on this girl after all this time. I just have to wonder why. I mean, I have old guy best friends from my past that I miss from time to time and think of them fondly but I don’t do what my boyfriend is doing. I appreciate that we have all grown up and moved on with our lives, moved cities etc, and they all have long term relationships now and I respect that.\n\nSo, I confronted him and just told him that I’ve tried to be understanding of the situation but I feel like it’s more than a friendship feeling that he’s harbouring for her, and that it’s making me feel really sad. He became defensive and began to yell and said he only interacts with her because she comes up on his feed, so I admitted to him that I muted her and so he’s lying. \n\nBut now this whole topic of conversation has been derailed because he is now only focusing on the fact that I muted her without his knowledge. I know that was wrong of me to do and I have been apologetic toward him for that, but I also feel like he’s now using this as a scapegoat to get out of explaining himself and his feelings toward her (which he claims is non-romantic) so he’s not addressing it properly at all.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here. He’s saying that he had to drop her from his life because of me, which annoys me that he’s putting that blame entirely on me when I was the one who was excited to met her in the beginning and she didn’t want a bar of it. It’s like he’s completely forgotten how she had behaved and how he set boundaries with her. I feel like he regrets doing so. I just don’t know how to handle this now or what to do.

  "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for his ex best friend&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me (26f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been dating for four years. We have a great relationship usually and we are genuinely each others best friends. But before we began dating he had this girl best friend (27f), they were very close, used to hang out all the time, talk most days and would even share a bed if he stayed over at her place. He admitted to me that he had a crush on her but that she was not interested in him so nothing happened romantically between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we began dating I was keen to meet her but she was pretty rude towards me during our first interaction and showed no interest which completely threw me off. She would then proceed to invite my boyfriend to lunches and dinners or over to stay at her house and exclude me, which annoyed my boyfriend as he felt it was purposeful and unnecessarily mean of her, so he would try to include me in the plans which would then make her uninterested and the plan wouldn’t go ahead. If we ever were all together in a group setting she would make me feel highly uncomfortable and do things like be very overly touchy feely with him, behaving in a girlfriend-like manner. One time even grabbing his leg under the table and said “we never hang out just us anymore” giving him puppy dog eyes, to which my boyfriend replied to her saying that they can still hang out just with me now also. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So essentially this sort of behaviour went on for awhile and at this point it’s safe to say I did not like her at all. She failed to be the cool person I thought she might have been and ended up being the stereotypical “girl best friend”. She moved cities so we stopped hearing from her as much and I grateful that my boyfriend respected me and our relationship enough to put boundaries in place with her without me even having to ask.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s been at least 3 years since then and we haven’t heard from her, we only have her on socials so I know she’s in a long term relationship now. But about four months ago I noticed my boyfriend had been liking her selfies which isn’t a common occurrence. So I asked him about it, after some time he said that he’s missing the friendship and is just thinking about old times with her. I tried to be understanding toward him but I also wanted him to understand how that doesn’t particularly make me feel good about myself or secure in the relationship considering he has liked her as more than just a friend before. He said her posts just show up on his feed and that gets him thinking about the past so then he likes the selfie. The topic was then dropped, but I didn’t really feel reassured by him and truly felt maybe it was more than just a friendship he was mourning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then I did something that I probably shouldn’t have, I muted her account on his Instagram so that her posts would no longer show up in the main feed, so that he would stop always seeing what she’s doing and thinking of her so intensely. I know that doing that was a breach of privacy and I shouldn’t have done it in hindsight, but at the time I felt justified to do it as a way to try and halt what was happening and partly to see if he would still go out of his way to react to her posts and stories.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to yesterday, I was using his phone (we use each-others phones for things openly) and I saw there was messages on Instagram between them, nothing that interesting but he had messaged a response to something on her story, she gave a meek reply and eventually left his final message on seen. She seemed fairly disinterested in the convo. Then I check her profile and he’s liking her posts, which means he’s been going out of his way to check up on her, and judging from the story reply it seems he wanted a way to strike up a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now it’s really not the conversation or the liking of the posts that is getting to me it’s the lying and the going out of his way to constantly check up on this girl after all this time. I just have to wonder why. I mean, I have old guy best friends from my past that I miss from time to time and think of them fondly but I don’t do what my boyfriend is doing. I appreciate that we have all grown up and moved on with our lives, moved cities etc, and they all have long term relationships now and I respect that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I confronted him and just told him that I’ve tried to be understanding of the situation but I feel like it’s more than a friendship feeling that he’s harbouring for her, and that it’s making me feel really sad. He became defensive and began to yell and said he only interacts with her because she comes up on his feed, so I admitted to him that I muted her and so he’s lying. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now this whole topic of conversation has been derailed because he is now only focusing on the fact that I muted her without his knowledge. I know that was wrong of me to do and I have been apologetic toward him for that, but I also feel like he’s now using this as a scapegoat to get out of explaining himself and his feelings toward her (which he claims is non-romantic) so he’s not addressing it properly at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where to go from here. He’s saying that he had to drop her from his life because of me, which annoys me that he’s putting that blame entirely on me when I was the one who was excited to met her in the beginning and she didn’t want a bar of it. It’s like he’s completely forgotten how she had behaved and how he set boundaries with her. I feel like he regrets doing so. I just don’t know how to handle this now or what to do. I love him an incredible amount but I don’t want to feel like I’m his second choice. It doesn’t look like he’s going to see eye to eye with me on this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In all honesty I don’t even know if I would be comfortable with them rekindling the relationship given the way she has treated me in the past and my gut feeling that there’s something slightly more to the friendship. I’m just lost and need advice as I can’t talk to anyone else about this. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I feel like my boyfriend still has feeling for his ex bestfriend (who he once had feelings for) because I’ve caught him numerous times going out of his way to check her socials&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "I (22, M) met my GF (20, F) very recently (almost 5-ish months back). She is the loveliest, purest, and sweetest human being I've ever met. After around 3 months of dating, we committed to a relationship. This is my first-ever romantic relationship.\n\nI want this relationship to work but lately, it has been feeling like a burden on me sometimes. My GF has clinical anxiety and needs me to constantly talk to her at least 2-3 times a day (on call) for reassurance. Till 6 pm, I'm at work so usually I just text her and call sometimes. During texts, I cannot seenzone her reels/memes (sometimes I'm at work and open IG just to check her texts). I have to explicitly state that I'm busy and I'll watch her memes/reels later. If I don't do this, she gets hurt. I also have to call and talk to her after work whenever she pleases even though a lot of the times I'm dead tired and just need some \"me\" time. If I tell her that I don't have the energy to talk to her, she again gets upset -- although she's trying to understand my position too nowadays. She does try and it is something I admire about her.\n\nToday, she had a really bad anxiety episode because her roommates went on a walk without telling her. She felt left out. This triggered her anxiety. She called me to tell this and I tried to support her the best way I know but she didn't like it. She proceeded to call me 4-5 times throughout the night. Everytime I tried to talk to her, just listen to her and support her but it wasn't working until the final call when it did and my words worked for her and reassured her. The final call happened around 3 am.\n\nShe has a lot of insecurity too due to a bad childhood. Any minor incident triggers her anxiety and then she dumps this anxiety and all of her problems on me. This happens very frequently. I listen to her and try to help too but it's starting to drain me.\n\nShe made it clear to me that she is a \"clingy\" person during our first few dates. I didn't mind that. I committed to her knowing full well that she'd need a lot of effort from my side, but what's happening right now seems a bit too much for me to handle and I certainly did not anticipate that it would be this extreme. I need suggestions on how I can fix the situation.\n\nI love her and minus these issues, I think she's a really amazing human and a thoughtful GF. But these issues are getting in the way and in the process, I'm draining myself too. I feel that I'm her coping mechanism. I want to talk to her about all these problems too but every time I try to talk to her, she gets very hurt. It feels like I'm walking on eggshells. I have to be very careful about the words I pick when talking to her. She is super sensitive. I just can't keep talking to her 24/7. I need time for myself. I need time to miss her too sometimes. Both of us can't afford therapy too and the concept of therapy itself is frowned upon in our families. \n\nIn 2 months, I'm leaving the country and its going to be long distance from then onwards. I love her but I don't know how we can keep a healthy relationship if it continues like this.\n\nP.S. idk if this whole story was coherent or not. I wrote this at 6 am. Since her call at 3am, I couldn't sleep but think about us. Please any help is appreciated.",

We befriended very quickly at about age 6-7, and until we were about 14 he was absolutely my best friend. then I moved and changed schools, and we lost touch, but regained it at about 18. \n\nNeither of us has been in a relationship, we're both autistic so it's had to start anything w girls (and in my case also with men since I'm bi - this will be important later) and about a year ago we decided to make a fake tinder account, just to see what it's like and how it works. \n\nBit of backgroun: Mike had the biggest crush on one of our classmates, \"Kay\" (F, same age as us). They had all their classes together, but he never even attempted to talk to her. I had some classes with Kay, and I remember she was very funny if a bit mean. Mike crushed on her hard since he was 9 and he still had a crush on her when I moved and changes schools. \n\nWhen we were looking at tinder we found Kay's profile, and I said something like that's the girl you had a crush on! and he basically acted very embarrassed and told me to just close tinder and we should leave it behind and stop, so I did and we didn't speak on that again. \n\nAbout a month ago I decided to re-make tinder, and surprise, I found Kay again. Thinking she definitely remembered me as her middle school classmate (since I remembered her) I swiped right on her, and she swiped right on me too, but didn't remembered me, so i reminded her we went to school together, and i wanted to catch up. She was willing, we talked a lot about what has changed since then, why I moved, etc and it turned out my work is near her uni, and we decided to meet and talk some more, and it went really well and I really like her as a friend, unsure about the romantic aspect yet, since she hasn't said anything even remotely romantic to me and I'm new to this so I'm waiting for her to make the first move. \n\nSince then I went over to Mike, and told him I met Kay, and his face just dropped. He wanted to know everything, why we met, when, where, and I told him I met her on tinder since I think it was completely normal to swipe right on someone i know/knew irl. He got extremely pissed, started shouting, told me he never stopped having crush on her and he was sure I knew and I told him that I had no idea that, but since that bothers him I won't see her again, and then he said \"Of course she wasn't interested in me, I didn't know she's into fags\" and that pissed me off a lot. I told him who the fuck he thinks he is, thinking it's okay to call me that, and if he apparently had a crush on her for nearly 15 fucking years it's just pathetic he never bothered to talk to her, and I just left, unwilling to listen to anything else he wanted to say to me. \n\nThat was a week ago, and since then we haven't talked to each other. I admit I don't think I did the right thing but also I really like Kay as a friend so far, but I would hate to lose Mike's friendship. Should I apologize first? I really don't want to talk to him since he called me a slur, but I did fucked up first when i decided to meet with Kay without telling him, and maybe I should be the one to extend the olive branch. Also. Should I stop talking to Kay?\n\nTLDR: my friend called me a slur after I met with a girl he had a crush on since elementary school. should I apologize to him or just end the friendship?

How do I reassure him I love him and this changes nothing?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "communityName": "r/relationship_advice",
  "parsedCommunityName": "relationship_advice",
  "body": "I [26F] am in graduate school, and yesterday afternoon, they had a couple hours of free ice skating for graduate students. I’m not a good skater, but I went because it sounded fun and a bunch of friends were going. My boyfriend [29M] was not in town and couldn’t attend. I told him about the event beforehand and he said he had no problem with me going. We have been together for 4 years.\n\nAt the free skate, one of the people there is from the same program (~50 people), who I will call Doug. Doug [30s] is married with 2 young kids. Doug isn’t a close friend of mine at the program, I’d say we’re friendly acquaintances. Turns out, Doug took figure skating lessons when he was young and is quite a skilled skater, so he was giving me and others there from our program some tips on how to improve our skating ability. \n\nOver the course of an hour, while I was trying to go faster / get better, and I ended up losing balance and nearly falling 2 times. \n\nBoth of these times, I was near Doug, and he stuck out his arm for me to grab so I could stabilize. I was very grateful. I ended up coming off the ice right after the second time because I didn’t want to nearly fall again and my ankles were getting tired.\n\nI was not near Doug the whole time, just the times where I tripped because I was trying more advanced moves then. \n\nWhen I was walking home, I was texting my boyfriend that I was just leaving the event and that I nearly fell twice. I said Doug prevented me from actually falling. My boyfriend freaked out, he said “Why did you go ice skating with Doug” “So this guy was skating next to you the whole time” and on about me falling into his arms. I didn’t fall into his arms. I grabbed 1 arm for 2 seconds to stabilize. I reminded him that Doug is married and there was nothing romantic about it. He said it’s not about Doug. He said I should be ice skating with girls, and my behavior demonstrates “blatant disrespect.”\n\nHe claimed I would freak out if roles were reversed and he was saving some girl from falling ice skating. I really don’t think that’s true. He said if he found out about this from another source, he’d suspect cheating. \n\nI’m at a loss. Did I disrespect my boyfriend by accepting help from a male to prevent me falling while ice skating?\n\ntldr: Went ice skating, nearly fell twice, same guy helped me not fall. Boyfriend feels disrespected.",

Bubba, and the little Bubba-lings on the ice trying their best while one of their kids is skating circles around them. \n\nI’m clearly competent when I’m skating. Now I’m not that good. Dispel those myths. For others that can skate I’m slightly above average at best.\n\nWhen I’m out there, and there’s someone I happen to be near that falls and it looks like they need help, I’ll help. You’re on the ice, and skate blades *will* slide if you don’t use your edges properly. It’s not a simple thing to help someone up from the ice. Normally you’ll get on your belly, get your feet beneath you, get your center of gravity, and off you go. People who don’t skate don’t know how to do that stuff, so they need help. Even if I’m at the other side of the rink, it won’t take anyone long to pass by you. \n\nSee, I’ll help out. I know I can, and the skate guards are usually busy watching the shitty skaters since they’re more likely to get hurt or hurt someone else. So yeah, I’m gonna help someone get up. I’ll ask if they’re hurt, and help them off the ice and get to whomever they need to get to if they are hurt. It’s not sexual, I’m just trying to help the rink, the employees, and mostly I’m trying to grow hockey by being helpful and helping folks have a good time. \n\nPush comes to shove, BF either needs to trust his gf or break up.",

I did not ask him if he wanted another one and I did not just give him another one. And it doesn’t explain the second missing pill. I don’t drop my pain pills. I don’t argue with gas lighters so I said “you’re right I must’ve dropped one” and pretended to believe that he “asked” me for the other. Should I quit seeing this guy?",

He said “I took two, the one you gave me when you got here and then another when we went to bed and  you asked me if I wanted one” and said maybe I dropped the other one. He’s gas lighting me. I did not ask him if he wanted another one and I did not just give him another one. And it doesn’t explain the second missing pill. I don’t drop my pain pills. I don’t argue with gas lighters so I said “you’re right I must’ve dropped one” and pretended to believe that he “asked” me for the other. Should I quit seeing this guy?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "I(25m) have been dating my boyfriend(31m) for about 4 months. The second time we met, he noticed my birthmark on my lip and asked me questions about it, but say it didn't bother him. We live about 2 hours apart, so we don't meet up a lot. We were texting around 8pm like we normally do and he say that he is worried about my birth mark being something else he didn't what so I told if he want I can get std scanning and he said it would make him feel better. I was a virgin until I met him, so the test was to put him at ease . When I told him I did the test but didn't talk about my birthmark to the doctor, he got pissed and went off on me asking why I didn't bring it up, and that was the whole point. I told him we could talk about it tomorrow because I was overwhelmed. The next day, we talk about it, and he thinks my birthmark is hpv. But I'm confused. Why bring it up after we have done pretty much everything and not before we did anything? Also, when we did talk about it again, he said I was saying anything, so when I told him how I felt, he told me I didn't care about that. He only cares about my birthmark being hpv. I like him a lot and don't know what to do, but I feel like this is a lot to deal with over not trusting your partner. So what should I do? Also from mobile and English is not my first language. Tldr My boyfriend thinks my birthmark on my lip is hpv and  doesn't trust me even after we have done all kinds of sexual stuff already. \nIf anyone needs more context, I will be happy to provide it because idk what to. do",

  "body": "how do I (F28) tell my husband (M33) that I want a divorce?\n\nI'm miserable. So so miserable. We used to be really happy, and like each other. Since our daughter was born, everything has changed. She's almost a year old, and he's yet to do anything to help with her. He sleeps in a different room to me (and the baby, she's still in my room) so he's never done a night feed, or rocked her back to sleep, or anything like that. He doesn't sort her meals, her bottles,  he doesn't do laundry or clean the house, he sits on his ass constantly and just plays on his phone. No matter how much I say I need help with every day things, he always says he'll change but doesn't. We argue every single day. He's self employed, works constantly and still brings home hardly anything. What he does earn, he takes for petrol in the car, vaping and tattoos. This has been on going for years, he has a job for a bit then gets fired and doesn't do anything for a while until he goes to the next thing. For 6 years I've single handedly been financially responsible for every single thing. All the bills, the rent, etc is all down to me. We're in a lot of debt, and I pay my own as well as his too. And obviously now we have a child, I'm also doing all the parenting. I do 99% of her care, and he maybe gives her a bottle once every so often. His patience is awful, and his attitude is worse. He constantly believes I'm cheating, If I'm on my phone he wants to know exactly who I'm texting and what we're talking about. It isn't because he's interested it's because he thinks it's someone else. I want to divorce, and be free I'm already doing everything alone so it makes no difference. I feel like I'm trapped though, he has no where else to go if I ask him to move out, he can't afford to get a place of his own. The house we live in is owned by my father, ànd every bill etc is in my name so I'm not leaving. Doesn't matter what we say he thinks we're happy. He can't take the hint I'm miserable and wish he'd go away. Despite it all I want him to be okay moving forward, and I'm worried about hurting his feelings saying I'm done. I'm worried about custody, and his family (who don't like me anyway) and the impact of that too. I'm worried the opinions of everyone else with this. And I don't even know how to say I'm done. I've been trying for 6 months to tell him but he says he'll change and things will be different. I don't know how to do it but I know I need to. \n\nI'm sorry this is a lot of rambling, just feel like I'm at breaking point with life in general. Mental health isn't great, and I need to escape. I don't want to keep trying to make this work when I don't feel anything towards him but resentment\n\nEdit: in response to the constant \"why did you have a kid with him\" comments, because I'm obviously an idiot and I've ruined her life already by dragging her through this. I don't need the reminders that I'm a shit mother, I'm already aware. I'm trying my best for her and she's always first. I'd have started this process months ago but I'm afraid of him alright?",

We are not married/not common law and no kids. We have been going through unhappy times and ever since we moved in our new house that we purchased we have found out that there are some fundamental lifestyle and way of living life differences between us. We were constantly fighting on small things, she always is jealous if I spend  time without her, thinks I am cheating on her, that I don't love her enough and I am not keeping her happy. In spite of all this she wants to marry me because we have been together for 3 years and marriage is the only thing missing in her life. She is well successful in her work. All her friends,family are married so I understand the pressure. \n\nWe went to couples counseling and did a 21 day extensive relationship boot-camp, which she suggested. After the boot-camp the counselor and we both came to the conclusion that we both are on the fence about the relationship. The counselor also said she suffers from emotional disregulation and borderline personality only towards romantic partner's, due to her previous divorce and abuse and failed relationships. The counselor said it will take a gigantic effort on her part to work throughout therapy to get out of it (1-2 years) and only she can do it to change it. She still is in denial and thinks that I play a role in her emotional disregulation. She goes throughout these mood swings from a bitter fight to a very caring and lovely dovey person in a matter of hours. This has caused a huge emotional toll on my mental health to the point that I feel trapped and unhappy all the times. I cannot openly talk to my family/friends and focus at work is also suffering. \n\nI honestly don't feel any feelings towards her and I have told her this but she is not willing to accept it and says we need to try harder and is not willing to let go. She constantly tells me how I am not doing enough to make up to her. The reality is I cannot give anymore and I have tried my best but I cannot help her unless she works on her self and that is what the counselor also concluded. \n\nI don't want to break her heart before valentine but I have no feelings and she wants to celebrate valentine day. My biggest issue is for her to come to the table accept the relationship is over and start to figure out how to split the house or rent it or buy me out and move on ion our life's. We got a new house in July 2022 and have a 820K mortgage, with the hope that we will start a family but it just turned out to be completely different. \n\nWhat shall I do to convince her that this is over and we need to move on and deal with the house, knowing that she is this emotional disregulation and borderline personality and my worry is that she might get to aggressive/bitter/vengeful if I stand my ground and walk away.\n\nI am an immigrant here (no family in Canada) she has family here and I feel I am alone with no support and I have cried alone many times due to all this emotional stress.

  "body": "Tl;dr: my sister started dating my coworker shortly after my coworker’s breakup with another coworker, even though I explicitly was against them getting together so soon. No one told me everyone thought poorly of me, it’s been a year. What do I do?\n\n\nI work in tech retail, and have around 90 coworkers. We are very tight knit, and got along very well. I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it. I feel so stupid, and it may sound stupid but to realize how many relationships in my life may have just been fake- how do I continue living? This is a nightmare and I just want out.  What do I even do now?",

We’ve currently been married for 4 days, and I am sadly writing this during my honeymoon.\n\nMy stepdaughter19 has always been vindictive towards me despite my years of trying to bond with her. I’ve done countless of things. I invited her to be one of my bridesmaids and she showed up to my wedding in a white fancy dress(not the one my husband specifically bought her for the wedding) and refused to change so I kicked her out the party. She decided to leave even though I told her she was welcome to stay and sent my husband this text about she thought it would be okay and even suggested that maybe I was worried she’d look better then me and she didn’t want to ruin my special day.\n\nWe are currently at this honeymoon resort in Florida. My husband slept the whole flight and then argued with me about his daughter and how she’s just a kid. He thinks I don’t understand because I have no children. We’ve only went out a few times here, when we put away a good chunk to be able to splurge here at the restaurants and events. It’s our honeymoon and this might be tmi but we’ve only had sex once!\n\nWe’re not arguing no more but he’s still being distant. He knew I was very excited to go to the beach because at home it is still very cold, and I tried asking him to go this morning, and he just goes “I don’t really feel like it.” And that I should go myself. He’s spent most of his time in this hotel, except going out to dinner with me a few times, which is so upsetting. I feel like we’re ruining our whole honeymoon. We’re here for two weeks so I still have time to fix it, even though I feel like I shouldn’t have too, but I don’t want to ruin our time together. \n\nI showed him my other post and he said he may of made poor judgement and said he’d speak to his daughter. Now there’s someone commenting under my post and Im not sure if it is my stepdaughter or someone posing as my stepdaughter, I’m not sure if my husband told her. If so this, I think this marriage may not last long because I do not feel United with him. Advice?\n\nTL;DR: I kicked Stepdaughter out of wedding party resulting in big argument with my husband. Now he’s being cold during our honeymoon. Advice?",

She decided to leave even though I told her she was welcome to stay and sent my husband this text about she thought it would be okay and even suggested that maybe I was worried she’d look better then me and she didn’t want to ruin my special day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently at this honeymoon resort in Florida. My husband slept the whole flight and then argued with me about his daughter and how she’s just a kid. He thinks I don’t understand because I have no children. We’ve only went out a few times here, when we put away a good chunk to be able to splurge here at the restaurants and events. It’s our honeymoon and this might be tmi but we’ve only had sex once!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We’re not arguing no more but he’s still being distant. He knew I was very excited to go to the beach because at home it is still very cold, and I tried asking him to go this morning, and he just goes “I don’t really feel like it.” And that I should go myself. He’s spent most of his time in this hotel, except going out to dinner with me a few times, which is so upsetting. I feel like we’re ruining our whole honeymoon. We’re here for two weeks so I still have time to fix it, even though I feel like I shouldn’t have too, but I don’t want to ruin our time together. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I showed him my other post and he said he may of made poor judgement and said he’d speak to his daughter. Now there’s someone commenting under my post and Im not sure if it is my stepdaughter or someone posing as my stepdaughter, I’m not sure if my husband told her. If so this, I think this marriage may not last long because I do not feel United with him. Advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I kicked Stepdaughter out of wedding party resulting in big argument with my husband. Now he’s being cold during our honeymoon. Advice?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I have left that workplace but we still text every day.\n\nJenny is in full time school online and works part time. Prior to starting full time school, she worked for 7 years full-time to save money for post secondary, and has saved up $30,000. She's never lived anywhere but with them, and they don't make her pay any bills except for the insurance and gas on her car. Her mother (60) is an alcoholic smoker and has made Jenny buy her two packs of smokes a day for years, and makes Jenny pay for her drinking. She also steals money by using Jenny's debit card, to which Jenny gave her the pin. Both of her parents scream at her and emotionally and verbally abuse her. Her father has such explosive anger that Jenny can't handle anyone yelling in her vicinity. I am reasonably certain there's been physical abuse but it usually is emotional/verbal/mental, telling her she's useless, has no future, should give up on her hopes now, etc.\n\nTonight, her mom pushed her into a table and screamed in her face. She won't report it because \"she has to take care of her parents\" and she doesn't want me to report it.

She says she needs to stay home so that her parents are taken care of and don't emotionally cut her off. \n\nI don't think I can keep hearing about this abuse where she does nothing and I can't do anything and she won't leave.

  "body": "TLDR; My friend is in an abusive relationship and it’s causing her to treat me badly unintentionally. I can’t put up with this but I can’t leave her too. \n\nMy best friend is always full of drama. However, she (29F) has been with her new bf (40M) for 9 months and he’s showing some crazy alarming behaviours. \n\nShe moved into his place very quickly, and since she’s moved in his shitty behaviour is getting scary. He made her homeless kicking her out with a moments notice, also at a beet vulnerable time for her. he screamed and shouted down to her in public and physically assaulted a stranger in her presence, just because he was angry at her. \n\nThis was a fallout after she was sexually abused by someone and he messaged the abuser behind her back. Of course the guy denied everything and said she consented, so her bf just fully believed him and kicked her out on the basis that she’s a liar. She sent a screenshot of their conversation and it’s disgusting, they’re talking about her like a piece of meat. \n\nShe’s taking me on this ride every step, every voice note, every screenshot of the way and I’m STRUGGLING to be there for her. She’s not acknowledging ANYTHING i say, I spent days on end messaging and talking to her and i’m really exhausted. 3 of her best friends are all telling her the same thing and she’s not interested in listening so what does she want from us to keep sending all of this distressing information over?

  "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TLDR; My friend is in an abusive relationship and it’s causing her to treat me badly unintentionally. I can’t put up with this but I can’t leave her too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My best friend is always full of drama. However, she (29F) has been with her new bf (40M) for 9 months and he’s showing some crazy alarming behaviours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She moved into his place very quickly, and since she’s moved in his shitty behaviour is getting scary. He made her homeless kicking her out with a moments notice, also at a beet vulnerable time for her. he screamed and shouted down to her in public and physically assaulted a stranger in her presence, just because he was angry at her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was a fallout after she was sexually abused by someone and he messaged the abuser behind her back. Of course the guy denied everything and said she consented, so her bf just fully believed him and kicked her out on the basis that she’s a liar. She sent a screenshot of their conversation and it’s disgusting, they’re talking about her like a piece of meat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She’s taking me on this ride every step, every voice note, every screenshot of the way and I’m STRUGGLING to be there for her. She’s not acknowledging ANYTHING i say, I spent days on end messaging and talking to her and i’m really exhausted. 3 of her best friends are all telling her the same thing and she’s not interested in listening so what does she want from us to keep sending all of this distressing information over? Might be worth mentioning that i have ptsd from being sexually assaulted and grooomed as a child which she knows full well about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On top of this, I started a new job and I’m grieving a good friend of mine who suddenly passed.

  "body": "I (28M) lost my mom a few days ago. I live abroad and it's not possible for me to make it to the funeral. It's hard, but I do my best to go about my day. I didn't change anything to my work routine, because I can't afford to take days off, but did my best to check in my siblings (we live all over the country) and my Dad and extended family.\n\nMy partner (26F) of 4 years whom have been living with for 2 years has been displaying behaviors I found selfish and unsupportive through this tough time. The day I got the news is the only day I would say she showed some support. Since then, I feel it's business a usual for her and a little extra. \n\nThe day after the news, she asked me how my day was when I got home. Keeping light I essentially communicated that I am hanging in there, she then proceeded to talk about her day and from the we were off to bed. The following day, I came home to her buzzed; she gets kinky when she drinks, also she doesn't casually drink like that so it felt unusual. Turned on she kept kissing and hugging me in sensuel way while we were laying in bed, I wasn't participating I was just lying down a bit uncomfortable since I considered it not to appropriate cause of what I am feeling and going through. While that's happening I also realized that she had masturbated, because there was a porn video paused on her phone. I couldn't process all that at the moment so I just got up to get ready for bed when I came back she had knocked out.

  "html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I (28M) lost my mom a few days ago. I live abroad and it&amp;#39;s not possible for me to make it to the funeral. It&amp;#39;s hard, but I do my best to go about my day. I didn&amp;#39;t change anything to my work routine, because I can&amp;#39;t afford to take days off, but did my best to check in my siblings (we live all over the country) and my Dad and extended family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My partner (26F) of 4 years whom have been living with for 2 years has been displaying behaviors I found selfish and unsupportive through this tough time. The day I got the news is the only day I would say she showed some support. Since then, I feel it&amp;#39;s business a usual for her and a little extra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day after the news, she asked me how my day was when I got home. Keeping light I essentially communicated that I am hanging in there, she then proceeded to talk about her day and from the we were off to bed. The following day, I came home to her buzzed; she gets kinky when she drinks, also she doesn&amp;#39;t casually drink like that so it felt unusual. Turned on she kept kissing and hugging me in sensuel way while we were laying in bed, I wasn&amp;#39;t participating I was just lying down a bit uncomfortable since I considered it not to appropriate cause of what I am feeling and going through. While that&amp;#39;s happening I also realized that she had masturbated, because there was a porn video paused on her phone. I couldn&amp;#39;t process all that at the moment so I just got up to get ready for bed when I came back she had knocked out. The next day through the day she sent me messages and stickers (romantic ones) stating that misses me, I didn&amp;#39;t know what to reply cause I am just not feeling all that.

I don't know what to do, I've never been in a situation like this ever... I have some of his stuff currently. My friend suggested that I should tell him what I know and to see his reaction. But my gut is telling me to act like I don't know about the things he has done and get out of this relationship before it gets way too deep. I don't know what he might do if he knows what I know. He previously said how one of his roommates had a felony charge for assault. I'm 100% certain he was trying to gauge my reaction on that sort of thing. I'm scared and I'm really unsure of what I should do... I made a different post just last night but I really need some advice on what I should do. I don't want to put too much information just in case he finds this post.\n\n\n(Post from last night)\nSo I have known this person for a year from work but just started to get to hang out with him regularly since about the end of December of 2022. Everything has been going great and we have been getting along super well. He hasn’t been mean or abusive to me at all. He’s been really sweet tbh. He did start calling me sweets pretty early on which was a little odd but I have a feeling now it could of been love bombing but I could be wrong. Anyway back to the topic I had an instant thought to google his name. I can’t quite remember why I had the thought to google him but I was just curious on what I would find. So I don’t know his middle name but his first and last name match as well as his birthday on the report... so I’m pretty sure it is him that has a felony charge as well as misdemeanor charges against him too. The thing is that the felony is what is pretty scary... He has a charge for strangulation... I don’t know how I should go about ending this relationship... we haven’t officially set a boyfriend or girlfriend label but we already say “love you” to each other. What’s scary is having the feeling that I don’t want to end it because things have been going so well. I know it’s stupid especially since I now know this information about him. But now all my body is telling is that I need to leave before he decides to do this to me. I just don’t know how go about it since I’ve made it clear that I really do like him. I don’t have the excuse that I still like my ex since I told him how my last ex was a dick. I haven’t been afraid of him until finding out this information... He hasn’t made any clear attempts to do anything horrible to me even though we’ve been alone together many different times. But I’m sure it could be because it’s still in the beginning stages... He does know where I live and where I currently work so is their anything I should do to keep myself safe just in case this turns out really bad?",

He's a great boyfriend to me, and we are on the same page with most things.\n\nHere's the issue.\nMy older brother passed away about four years ago. It was the worst day of my life, as I watched him pass away suddenly and didn't have time to prepare mentally. He was the closest brother to me. I have three other brothers. Two of them are long distance and there's a huge age gap so we've never been close. And the other brother, we can't stand each other. (Long story). I have a pretty good relationship with the rest of my family; parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. But every since lost the closest brother to me, it feels like I don't have any siblings at all.\n\nMy boyfriend has a really close relationship with his sister, and on the surface, I'm really glad he has that. I know how beautiful that relationship can be because it's very similar to the one I had with my brother. However, deep down, there are a ton of emotions that I can't express to anyone.\nI'm so confused about why I feel so angry inside sometimes. When he tells he stories about them hanging out, or when I see them joking with one another, or just doing anything really, I get emotional. I'll step away and bawl my eyes out in the bathroom, or after I get off of the phone with him, I'll cry myself to sleep. Also, I feel guilty because sometimes I get angry out of nowhere. To him, it looks like I'm being moody or distant. But inside, I'm a mix of sad, angry, jealous, and resentful. I feel so childish and disgusting for having these feelings but I literally cannot turn them off. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should talk to him about it because don't know how he'll take it. Seeing them together makes me feel like a bitter, envious person.\nWhat should I do?",

I feel so childish and disgusting for having these feelings but I literally cannot turn them off. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I don&amp;#39;t know if I should talk to him about it because don&amp;#39;t know how he&amp;#39;ll take it. Seeing them together makes me feel like a bitter, envious person.\nWhat should I do?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Every possible curveball life could throw at you was thrown at us, but we managed and I thought kept coming out stronger. About a year a half I got diagnosed with a mental illness and had a really hard time. During that time I had to spend a week in the hospital. I just found out that during that week my SO was attempting to get women to come over to have sex. I mean he was AGGRESSIVE with it. It was over a 5 day span and sent photos of his little companion to these ladies. Unsolicited might I add. Both women respectfully declined. One was MY FRIEND the other was someone random he knew. That one specifically mentioned me multiple times and he had no respect for me at all. He blew me off in the texts and made me into nothing. I am still processing and healing and honestly deciding if I want to stay with him over this. Now over the weekend I found out literally from the day we got together he has in some way entertained a woman. Like he was always keeping people on the back burner just in case. Nothing within the last year I saw but all prior. That’s honestly the reason I’m even still here is because it’s all from over a year ago. Although the pain feels like it happened yesterday. He also isn’t begging and pleading for me to stay. It’s like he just expects me to not go anywhere. Like he knows he doesn’t have to put any effort in. Well, this past weekend on Facebook he joined a group. A group for friends with benefits. It’s literally a group to meet up with people to have sex. Oh yeah one other big detail EVERY SINGLE INCIDENT his excuse is “I don’t remember doing that. I mean I must have you can see it there, but I don’t remember.” And he uses that as an excuse to not be accountable for what he’s done. Well ends up he joined TWO of those groups. When I confronted him the ever so common “I don’t remember” makes its appearance. He made me feel awful for getting mad about any of it so I can’t ever process or deal with this. We can’t talk about it because he “doesn’t remember” and I’m lost on how to handle this. Aside from this he is literally my hero. I’m having a really difficult time and he does everything he can for me and more. He also has become the greatest step dad to my three children. I don’t want to lose him, but I don’t know if it’s salvageable without communication. \n\nIf it happened a year ago or more, how do you go about forgiving the person or should you just move on?",

However, we have had the long-term conversation and the &amp;quot;what are you looking for&amp;quot; conversation.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think we need to start acting like a family unit; I understand the need for him and me both to have our time with our own children.  I do wish for us to do things together occasionally, though.  I would like to get to know her more and vice versa with him and my children.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nine months isn&amp;#39;t incredibly long, no... but for him to have responded to me in a way that made me feel like we both want the same thing for our future, I&amp;#39;m confused as to why he keeps us so distanced always.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "body": "[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipproblems/comments/10u0wbt/am_i_23f_being_ghosted_by_a_guy_26m_who_ive_been/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nThanks everyone for the advice and I've been distracting myself and been talking to other guys! But recently the guy in question has messaged me out of the blue (and on my phone number not Snapchat) and apologized how he's been busy with work and school. He also was saying how he hates how he doesn't have time for people he actually wants to spend it with and that he doesn't want to date me right now, cause he doesn't want to hurt me by being too busy to hang out with me or texting back. It was honestly a surprise to me cause we've barley mentioned dating but only having something casual while trying to get to know each other. Then at then end, he says that he would love to be friends right now. \n\nSo if you read the previous post, you know that i really have no relationship experience whatsoever and I also have friends/family who have dated before, so they really don't understand my experience of barley getting hit on or asked out and never having a boyfriend.  So when i first started writing a little rough draft to him, i was kind of putting all my feelings into it 💀 like how it hurt that he's been ignoring me and wondering what he means by being \"friends\"? When i showed it to my mom, aunt, and friends, they made me rework EVERYTHING. Like how he shouldn't know how I'm feeling, don't mention anything that I've done because if he cared then he would of asked these past couple of days. Also saying that if I put any hit that I'm still interested in him, then he might use that to put me in his back pocket, cause we don't actually know if he's dating/talking to other people. And they did a really good job of explaining/justify their reasoning on why I shouldn't send what I wrote. So i honestly chopped the majority of what I wrote and just send a text, saying that he's fine with being busy, thanks for letting me know, and how i wouldn't staying friends with him. He has yet to reply.\n\nI honestly feel like i react with my heart than my head the majority of the times when it comes to romantic relationship. So I honeslty don't know what to do? Cause I'm still interested in him but i don't want to keep waiting and then have some hope for something that might or might not happen. I've been trying to keep myself busy with school and trying to find a job in my degree. I've also being trying to train for a half marathon and might volunteer for a maid cafe that's coming to convention! I've also been talking to a guy (guy 2)  here and there that's in my school, but i just feel guilty cause what if something does happen with guy 2 and i just feel guilty and hoping something happens with the other guy? \n\nSorry for the long post and thanks :)",

This applies both to your situation and any situations where you are the first to confess feelings, etc.  Anywhere where others would tell you to be indifferent and short.\n\nWill this approach of saying how you genuinely feel work?  Ah, I don't know. That also depends on your definition of what works. Sometimes it will lead to satisfying deep relationships where a terse note wouldn't, but other times it would not. So it's not a magic \"I'm going to make him like me\" approach, but there's nothing like that anyway.\n\nThe point is that these notes are often for yourself, rather than for him. For you to know that you've exposed how you feel, that you've made things clear and now he can figure out of he wants a relationship or not. And that itself can make you feel better and can help you get out of ruminating about him (perhaps).\n\nIn any case, they are unlikely to hurt. Could he still ignore you and not respond? Of course. But that's the situation now anyways.  So it's no worse, but you needn't feel like there's some \"right\" way of responding that you don't know due to your inexperience. \n\nNow as to \"putting you on back burner\" -- that's the part I really don't get. What's the harm? Suppose he does that to you -- and then what?  It's one of those phrases that sounds like it's a bad thing, but when you think of it, there's nothing really bad to it. As long as you don't change _your_ behavior.  Meaning: continue chatting with other guys, going out on dates if you get any, continue moving on and living your life. Will he come back to bring you back from that \"back burner\"?  Who knows. But it doesn't matter, as long as you are not sitting around and waiting for him.  If he does come back, you can reevaluate then.\n\nSorry for this beast of a comment. There's nothing wrong with the text you did write. But just... Don't be afraid to be yourself. Just because lots of other people buy in to \"standard advice\", doesn't mean that they have some secret knowledge. And showing interest in other people very rarely hurts. Typically it helps, and helps a lot. Again, as long as you are not sitting around changing your life for one guy or bombarding him with love notes all the time. But expressing how you feel once? Why not. Let him be the one worrying about how to respond, while you breathe easier for having put your feelings in words.",

My best friend (F19) is single and has known him for a couple years longer than I have. We all met in college. I'm moving in a couple of months and I confided in my friend that I don't want a long distance relationship so our relationship might unfortunately come to an end later this year.\n\nNow for my suspicions: So my friend has always acted as if she \"dislikes\" my boyfriend. Whenever we were together she'd always throw in a condescending joke or two but would ultimately still be friendly with him. Sometimes she would even hug him or otherwise touch him, however I tried not to think anything of it. She has also asked me several times when I plan on breaking up with him, which I find to be a really odd question to ask since it's none of her business. Recently she even posted a picture on Instagram with him, which I had no idea even existed. They've known each other for a longer time so they obviously have some inside jokes that I'm not part of. Whenever it's the three of us the vibes are kind of off. I've had some doubts before but I've tried to ignore them because I don't want to lose either of them. \n\nWell, now I actually have some doubts and I need to know if I'm being delusional. My mom recently met my friend and instantly told me to beware. According to her she acts really suspicious and touchy-feely with my boyfriend when I'm not looking. Idk what to think. Our relationship is stable but I have a feeling she might try to get with him once I move in a couple months. I know he's his own person and can't be \"stolen\" but tbh I would find it really upsetting if my closest friend got with my boyfriend. \n\nI talked to my boyfriend and he said that he doesn't believe she likes him since she's so mean to him. On the other hand I know some girls that act mean when they actually like someone. \n\nWhat should I do? Am I crazy?",

She lives +300 miles away from me, but I was going to move to her city at summer -23.\n\nWe clicked right away. She felt so nice during messages and we started to send voice messages many times a day. We finally met beginning of december -22 and we had great time. She is the most beautiful girl I have dated (and I've dated over 100 girls), so nice, intelligent and we have so much common. We spent 2 weekend together in december and everything was so good. Amazing sex, amazing conversations etc.\n\nProblems started because I had booked 3 months trip for SEA beginning of january -23. We had plans to spend new years eve together but I got sick, so we had to cancel it. So we have met last time maybe around 20.12.22.\n\nSo I went to this trip (I'm here now) and we continued to send voice messages every day. Thinks went well few weeks, but then answering time started to get slow from girl. 2 days, 3, days... Last time she answered 6 days later. But she always send me these 5-10min long voice messages and she sounds intrested. Always asking lot of questions too.\n\nBut now it's been already 8 days and she hasn't answered. So it feels like it's fading all the time.\n\nHow can I keep her intrested because I can't meet her for 2 months still? And If she takes week to answer messages already. Of course it's not mandatory to speak every day but +week seems little long.\n\nBecause our voice messages are quite long (+5min) so it takes some time from me too to message her back. Now I'm wondering that are our messages too long and that's why she takes so much time to answer? But I proposed video calls last time and she didn't answer. Although I know that she is very busy right now and I'm not her biggest priority.\n\nBut yeah complicated situation. Short question is that how can I keep this lead warm?",

  "body": "I'm 28 and my boyfriend is 42. We are coming up on our 1 year next week. We moved quickly. We moved in together after a couple months of dating. We were coworkers / friends a year prior to getting together. He made a move on me my last day of the job we had together. We no longer work together.\n\nMonths ago (maybe September or October) I found out he was following hundreds of half naked women on Instagram and tiktok. All of a sudden I just had a feeling. I don't know why or how. I just all of a sudden knew. I looked to give myself the peace of mind that I was wrong but he was following hundreds of those types of accounts. During this time i was also on his phone for whatever reason (with him present and he handed it to me) and an Instagram notification came up. It was his friend sending him another profile. I thought it over for a couple days before bringing it up to him. I'm fine with the occasional porn or what not but this was excessive. \n\nWe worked through it over a couple days. He offered to unfollow the accounts. I didn't ask him for it. He offered and he did unfollow a lot of accounts. I thought he handled it really well at the time. At the time he also told me he didn't think anything of it because it wasn't an issue in other  relationships. His friend that sends him the profiles is also married and it isn't an issue in his relationship. He also told me he rarely goes on Instagram so he didn't realize how excessive it was. He did agree that it was excessive. The two things about how he handled it I didn't like was the comment about his friend and him saying he doesn't care what I do on my accounts and isn't watching them. \n\nFast forward to now. He is on instagram ALL the time. Never in front of me but I can see that he is active. I asked him about it a while back and he said that his habits can change. I don't know if this is true or he was trying to tell me what I thought I needed to hear before. He is still following a decent number of those types of accounts. I also found out he turned off his Instagram notifications. When I asked him why he did that he said because it caused an issue. I took that as instead of fixing the issue now he is hiding. \n\n Lately I have been obsessed with seeing if he is online or when he was online last. I have been doing it for the last couple months. I didn't do it at first but recently. He is online a lot. I still get upset about what happened and believe it is still ongoing. Again I'm fine with the occasional porn or whatever but not with how excessive it is. I find it hurtful and disrespectful especially after we already discussed it.\n\nI also feel like he isn't actually attracted to me. None of these girls look like me. I gained weight from going on an IUD and I don't work out as much as I used to. He has shattered my self confidence. \n\nIn the beginning of our relationship he didn't initiate. He did start to after I talked to him about it. I have told him I feel like he isn't attracted to me and he assures me that he is. I have told him a need more from him sexually. It lasts for about a week then goes back to normal. He also seems to care more about pleasuring himself than anything else. I had to tell him to touch me. He sometimes has issues with getting it up. He blames his medicine. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. I understand his older as well so his needs are different. His eyes are also closed the entire time we do anything. I asked him about it and he said he just wants to feel how good it is. He doesn't want to at least look at me sometimes but he can look at all those other girls. \n\nOn the other hand he makes me happy. We are good together. We never raised our voices at each other. We had issues but we discussed them. He helped me through my cat passing away. He is supportive and he encourages me. I can be myself with him. He wakes up early to make me breakfast before work and has dinner when I'm home. He also works just not as long as I day as me. \n\nI feel like I need to talk to him about this but I don't know how. I feel like it isn't fair to me to continue this way. I don't want to cause issue or make him feel like I don't trust him. I have been feeling this way for a long time. \n\nWe just signed a new lease and have a big trip planned for our anniversary. I don't think it's fair to either of us to continue like this.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",

I personally don’t care. He’s never been a bad sport about his weight, always cracking jokes about it and doesn’t let it hold him back, and he’s actively trying to lose weight, so I can look past that. \n\nI really do like him, and I just wished my family wasn’t so quick to judge someone they’ve never actually met. Every time they’ve interacted it’s because he’s been helping me, usually to carry heavy things to and from my moms car. He’s incredibly helpful. \n\nI’m certain the only reason they don’t like him, is one, because he’s on the darker side (we’re not white but somehow my family is still very racist) and two, because he’s a heavier guy (which I feel isn’t fair because no one in my family is exactly small or skinny themselves). \n\nI don’t really know what to do because I know if I introduce him to my family they’re going to tell me not to be with him or that they don’t like him, and there’s really not much I can do to change their mind. But if I don’t introduce him to them, it’ll just end badly because they’ll likely find out eventually considering his family already knows we’re dating. (Side note, they don’t really like me either. It’s another racism related thing along with some other personal stuff) \n\nWhat should I do?",

We've dated for 3 years, during our relationship we've done everything together, we’ve even traveled together and I thought we had a great relationship until one day she said her family is moving to a different state and that we need to breakup because she can't be in a long distance relationship. About a week after we broke up, I saw her snapchat stories and she was hanging out with a guy that I've never seen before. I assumed it's her new boyfriend, but when I messaged her to ask her about it, should would not respond. I knew she broke up with me to be with this guy, I felt replaced and betrayed. But instead of crying about it, I decide to focus on college and stay away from relationships.\n\nFast forward to my last year in college, I've met my current GF. We first met when I saw her crying in the parking lot in the morning, I asked what was wrong, she said her car is broken and there is no way for her to go to college. So I offered to drive her since we both study at the same college. That was 2 years ago and we've been together ever since. \n\nThe problem is that I get extremely jealous and possessive over her when I see other guys looking at her. Every time I'm not with her, I feel like she's cheating on me with other guys. I always have this feeling that she's  gonna abandoned me one day. She did not do anything to make me feel that way. I know it's not healthy, that's why I'm writing this post to Hopefully to get advice from people who were in my position. \n\nTLDR; My first GF broke up with me for another guy, now I feel that my current GF will do the same.

He said he had a good amount of money saved but I paid the rent, thinking he was spending this time wisely. He started going to job interviews in sweatpants and never changed job types. I had to push him to get going and this built resentment that he was taking advantage of my kindness. \n\nI planned a European vacation for us, paid for it, and asked him to just plan one day for us. At the airport, on our way to our destination, he revealed to me that he was in massive debt and didn’t know what to do. He was mopey and angry our whole vacation. Didn’t want to go to dinner on my birthday or do anything touristy because it cost money. I tried to make the best of it because I was looking forward to it and put so much energy planning this vacation. He never planned the day I asked for and got mad at me that I was mad about it. \n\nOver the years, I explained I felt I had too much on my shoulders. He was always job hopping, using all his time off when he didn’t need it, and not having it when he really needed it, and having to either get fired or quit.  This never changed. He would go a couple months or longer between jobs to the point I would have to nag him and ask what was going on. He would get angry and say as long as he pays his half, why do I care??  I didn’t feel secure. I would never do that to him because I feel it puts more pressure on your partner.\n\nFast forward to the thing that was the last straw for me. My mom almost died and needed emergency surgery. I left town last minute. At the same time, our water heater broke and we had no hot water. We live in an apartment so he just had to call and be there when they fix it. He said no he had too much on his plate. He left it for me. We had a conversation when I got back about how much that hurt me and he needs to help me more. The hot water issue continued over two months and his effort to help didn’t improve. He told me it wasnt a big deal to not have hot water but he knew it was important to me.\n\nThere’s more but that’s the core of it.\n\nWriting this out is helping me realize I don’t deserve this and I want someone more on my level. I plan on being alone for a long time. I know it’s normal to question your decision but sometimes I think we can keep growing together. I’m just not sure he’s interested in being responsible for himself. Instead of being an adult and finding a place to live , he’s going to quit his job and live with a friend. At times I feel I was used for the security I provided.  My heart gradually shut off to him. \n\nPlease someone tell me what you think. Obviously this is all the bad stuff but the good stuff feels so overshadowed.",

Sometimes I just want him to call me and say that he has arranged plans or even just get me a small chocolate bar from the store. He also doesn't focus on my pleasure unless I specifically ask him, whereas I love making him feel good.\n\n He said he just doesn't feel like doing these things and it really hurt me to hear that. When we are not together he doesn't really text me to ask about my day. I don't feel appreciated at all at times. I always go over to his place, wait for him to finish playing video games, bring him food and so on. \n\nHe told me that he had a really big crush on this  girl, his feelings werent reciprocated he feels like he doesn't have it in him right now to be more loving.

It was due to my stupidity and naivety of watching webcam girls and paying for shows.\n\nAnyway since we broke up, we have spent plenty of nights together where we would start arguing but ending the night having sex and saying we loved each other.

Now it’s been more than 5 weeks since we suggested baby steps. We start off by arguing how she doesn’t get excited to see me, she says I am not her priority, then we get into the thick of things and then she leaves my house or I leave hers feeling so happy. Then it has been a pattern of this. She still admits that she loves me but can’t let go.\n\nI try to let go because I love her so much, I always say to her she deserves so much better than me for what I have done and for that reason I try to let her go but I can’t do so either. \n\nWe are now almost in a limbo where we both love each other so much. She doesn’t see a future (which I don’t blame her for) but then always leaves my place happy and I am so desperate for one with her and have done a lot of fighting including sentimental things but when she hasn’t reciprocated, I can’t let go either so we are both stuck now and I asked her today if she wants to get back together with me as it has been 12 weeks since the break up and she said no.

  "body": "I (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for around 4 months. We met on a dating app, and after 2 months we decided to be official. As in, I asked her to be my girlfriend, she agreed. I don’t have much experience relationship wise, which fuels my belief that I could be acting clingy, but I do think it’s more than that.\n\nThroughout the relationship, in my opinion, every moment we’ve spent together in person has been great. We’ve talked about personal things like family, been intimate regularly, and at times it seems she doesn’t want the evening to end. So all good right… \n\n(Before I explain the next part, I should say to her credit she’s got a busy schedule, with work and other similar clubs and activities. All which are genuine reasons to be tied up during the day and weekends, and I wouldn’t expect her to ever stop doing something or change because of me. Nor do I expect us to be constantly in contact 24/7 or even every day. \n\nHowever, these are my concerns when apart: \n\n- Its always difficult to see her, and when we do hang out, it’s always limited time wise. We never spend an entire day together, and never the night. We only see each other roughly once every week/ week and a bit. This affects me, but alone isn’t the problem, I recognise her commitments. \n\n\n- The main issue lies in the seeming lack of effort. Every message takes hours for a response, so it’s difficult to discuss anything - (yes we could call but see next paragraph). Attempts to make plans when busy on her part, are rarely met with attempts to rearrange on particular days. 90% of plans derive from me.\n\n\n- I try calling occasionally just to talk or plan something,  but she almost never picks up - again could just be busy which I accept. However, missed calls only receive an apology text hours later. I never receive a call back. In fact, I don’t think she’s ever randomly called in four months just to talk to me- which I’ll admit is a bit upsetting. When she was away for a week with work, I thought I’d give her one call in the evening near the end of the trip to see how things were goings- I got 10mins of her time.\n\n- an example which actually affected me: Recently I had to travel back home for a sad event which she knew. Later that day I tried texting her as I simply wished to hear from her; it took two days to send a couple of messages back and forth due to not replying for several hours each time. Followed by a final ‘are you free tonight to call’, which received no response for 24 hours. Again, that being an apology text and no actual call. The reason for this being family visiting. A partially valid excuse, but in my head, if my partner ever texted asking to call after seeming upset or having been through something, I would not hesitate to give them my time, even just for half an hour. Would you not always do that for someone important?\n\n- for all points above, they feel even worse when combined with how she organises her time with others. I don’t expect to be a number one priority or to demand attention; but when someone regularly makes plans with friends and calls them in the evenings along with family etc, but then never calls their boyfriend once in four months….\n\n\nI appreciate anyone who made it through, I know it’s long. I know I’ll have to have a conversation with her but could do with some genuine honest advice before proceeding - whether it be to address my own issues or hers.",

I felt pressure to say it back, I didn’t at first but eventually did. She told me early on that she just knew I was “the one”. In many ways she backed it up every day, to the point where even though it was fast I couldn’t help but believe her.\n\nShe started bringing up marriage really fast, within a month, and wanted me to move in with her.\n\nI did end up moving in, but kept my apartment as I wasn’t ready to go all the way with it.\n\nI do believe her feelings for me, but for some reason I have had a hard time getting there in the same way. She has always seemed really caught up on money and materialistic things, and I have been spending a lot of money for us to have a nice lifestyle together, not exactly buying her gifts, but just us going out and having a good time together.\n\nIn many ways, she is everything I’ve ever wanted, but in other ways, she is not.\n\nWe line up on a lot of things with how our personal relationship is, but we differ greatly on finances and parenting, to name a couple. I think the fact that she moved so fast, and that’s not how I work, and I didn’t really respect my own boundaries, I’ve put myself in a situation where I feel just completely smothered. She wants to spend every waking minute together, and so do I, but I have to make time for 1-1 time with my kids and things like that as well. I guess no relationship is perfect, but I know she is committed ti making it work with me no matter what. She loves me with her whole heart.\n\nI don’t want to break it off with her, but at the same time I have a lot of anxiety about the relationship, I have a lot of anxiety about committing and moving forward. It doesn’t feel right for whatever reason even though I want it too so badly.\n\nWhen I started dating, I just felt like I wanted to find a beautiful girl who loves me for me, flaws and all, and who wants to spend her life with me and loves me with all of her heart. I found that. I’m with the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen and she loves me with all of her heart and wants to spend her life with me. She even knows about my mental health issue and accepts me fully, me for me, and wouldn’t change a thing about me.\n\nI don’t know why I can’t I commit and move forward?\n\nI also know I’m way too caught up on looks, and my attraction for her possibly clouds things for me….I don’t know..\n\nAs soon as I go to break it off, I get worried if I’ll ever find another girl like her, or if I’ll ever find another girl I’m attracted to like her, who wants to be with me in that way. I think this is tied to some self esteem issues deep down, or maybe it’s natural to think things like that during a breakup.\n\nI just wish I could get over this and move forward with her, but I don’t seem to be able too.

I've told her I've noticed her absence, how sex has come from great and frequent (4x a week!) to good and less frequent (1x a week). How I feel like she takes it as a chore. \n\nShe told me two days ago that she regrets not living alone before marrying me, getting to know the world a bit better. By the time we married, at 25, I had lived abroad, moved to another city in the country, and had many nice projects coming my way (grad school, super cool job, more projects abroad, etc). She had a dead end job. It all changed as we married: she moved to the new city with me, we helped each other through our projects.

I did it because I thought that's what the relationship needed if it was to blossom. But here I am: with a wife that doesn't enjoy having me around. I know things can be worked in couple's therapy, but I wonder if it's worth doing that with a person who probably doesn't want things to work anymore.

I get that, yet she does the same thing with romance novels? I understand that men and women (stereotypically mind you) have different things that excite them or get them off.

I've asked her if there's anything that I'm failing to fulfil, or if there's anything I can do better but she says our sex life, romantic life and day to day life are perfect! Yet she still wants to escape reality. Why is this?\n\nNow I do like to think I'm romantic, and when we have sex it can range from really passionate and hot to more romantic love making. Literally throwing her against the wall or gently loving her. Without getting into detail I always ensure she \"gets hers first\" (and last).\n\nI don't really want to talk to her about this again because she'll know that it's bothering me and that's the exact opposite of what a perfect manly man should do (a book man anyway).\n\nAny advice I could get?\n\nTL;DR Girlfriend reads lots of romance books (especially hot ones) yet has a problem if I watch porn.

  "body": "It sounds like the idea of confronting him makes you uncomfortable so I'm going to take that into consideration with my suggestions. \n\n\nFirst, when you do address this with him *do not* say anything about how uncomfortable confronting him is for you. That will give him the impression that you think you're possibly 'wrong' for confronting him or are just unsure of your position and whether or not you have a right to be upset about this. Don't apologize for anything. Like, at all. No 'sorry to bring this up' or 'sorry if I'm offending you' or any other kind of sorry statement. That gives him a 'weakness' to grab onto and could turn into a 'you *should* be sorry' situation when *he* is the one who should be sorry for inadvertently making someone feel uncomfortable, whether he meant to or not. \n\n\nSecond, don't make it all your fault. So no statements like 'it's just me, I'm weird that way' or 'I know it shouldn't be a big deal but it's one of my quirks'. Those are just more apology statements in disguise. Sorry for being me. Sorry for being the way I am. You don't need to explain to *anyone* why you don't want them to touch your body. *That* should be the given, the assumption. One should *always* assume others don't want their body touched because *that's the safe, respectful assumption to make*. It's the automatic default position of people who are respectful. \n\nSo, find a time to take him somewhere private at work (preferably close to the end of the day or end of the work week) and just very calmly say:\n\n\n\"I wanted to talk to you about touching my body when I don't want you to. You've done it a few times when saying good-bye to me and I don't like it and want you to stop doing it. I wanted to address this in private rather than waiting for it to happen again and having to address it in front of our colleagues. I'm sure you don't want to be deliberately touching your coworkers bodies when they don't want you to so I assumed you would want to know how I felt right away. I'm happy we can clear this up quickly with no fuss.\"\n\nAnd then leave the room. If he tries to continue the discussion or starts with things like 'you got the wrong impression' just respond with \"My only concern is establishing that there will be no more unwanted touching regardless of your reasons for it.\" If he responds with any sort of resistance, say \"I'd hoped we could resolve this amongst ourselves but if that's not possible I'll need to speak with HR.\" And then disengage and do not discuss it further. Go back to your desk and *immediately* email HR to give them a heads-up, describing your conversation with him word-for-word. Keep it factual and emotion-free. Just \"There was a situation with Coworker which I addressed today in (place). The conversation was as follows: (conversation). Due to his reaction I felt it prudent to loop you in. I don't wish to take any action at this time but wanted you to be aware of what has occurred.\"",

One should &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; assume others don&amp;#39;t want their body touched because &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s the safe, respectful assumption to make&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s the automatic default position of people who are respectful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, find a time to take him somewhere private at work (preferably close to the end of the day or end of the work week) and just very calmly say:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wanted to talk to you about touching my body when I don&amp;#39;t want you to. You&amp;#39;ve done it a few times when saying good-bye to me and I don&amp;#39;t like it and want you to stop doing it. I wanted to address this in private rather than waiting for it to happen again and having to address it in front of our colleagues. I&amp;#39;m sure you don&amp;#39;t want to be deliberately touching your coworkers bodies when they don&amp;#39;t want you to so I assumed you would want to know how I felt right away. I&amp;#39;m happy we can clear this up quickly with no fuss.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then leave the room. If he tries to continue the discussion or starts with things like &amp;#39;you got the wrong impression&amp;#39; just respond with &amp;quot;My only concern is establishing that there will be no more unwanted touching regardless of your reasons for it.&amp;quot; If he responds with any sort of resistance, say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d hoped we could resolve this amongst ourselves but if that&amp;#39;s not possible I&amp;#39;ll need to speak with HR.&amp;quot; And then disengage and do not discuss it further. Go back to your desk and &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; email HR to give them a heads-up, describing your conversation with him word-for-word. Keep it factual and emotion-free. Just &amp;quot;There was a situation with Coworker which I addressed today in (place). The conversation was as follows: (conversation). Due to his reaction I felt it prudent to loop you in. I don&amp;#39;t wish to take any action at this time but wanted you to be aware of what has occurred.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

  "body": "\nMy sister and I have an ok relationship, but I wouldn’t call us close. I moved out of state after college for work, and maintaining close familial relationships over the years has proved to be difficult, particularly with my sister, who is eternally “busy”. \n\nMy father (M86) passed away last July , and his will left everything in equal parts to me  and my sister, and named her as executor. My father was not anything close to wealthy, but he did have roughly $80k in savings, plus a fully paid-for house and a largish wooded property, each worth approximately $120k. \n\nShortly after the funeral, my sister and I talked and  agreed to split the savings, sell the house, and each of us will take one of the two vehicles  he owned. My sister was supposed to transfer the vehicles to our names, which involved filing a single piece of paper with the DMV within 120 days of my father’s death, but she “didn’t have time” to do it. This has turned what should have been a simple process into a bit of a nightmare, complicated even more by me living in another state. I am planning to fly down there in a few weeks to pick up the truck and drive it back. In the meantime I’ve been calling, texting and emailing her trying to figure out how we transfer the title. She ignores my texts and emails, and never returns my calls. To be fair, this isn’t entirely out of character for her, as even her 20-yr old daughter complains about not being able to get in touch with her. Still, a part of me is starting to wonder if my sister is trying to pull something unsavory here. \n\nBesides being my sister, as executor, she has a legal obligation to keep me informed with what’s going on with the estate. Which she seemingly has no interest in doing.  I’m not 100% sure how all this works,e.g. I don’t know if the will went to probate - based on the value of the estate it should have, but my sister didn’t respond to my questions about it - or if there’s any court involvement at all, or if there’s anything that I can do to help anyway. \n\nNow, do I think my sister is the type of person who would help herself to an outsized portion of my dad’s estate? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe? I do think that on some level my sister feels she “sacrificed” more for our parents, what with me moving far away right after college, and her staying in the same small town we grew up in. Not that either of my parents required any special care (either health wise or financially) in their later years. My sister has mentioned that in her opinion I have “lots of money” and “she’s the one with two kids in college”. \n\nI don’t know, I guess I’m just wondering why she’s avoiding me so much. A little communication would go a lot way. Am I making something out of nothing here?",

However, if the both of you are perfectly happy together, there’s no need to prepare yourself for any heartbreak. That’s not what love and relationships are about; these things can be scary because you’re not supposed to prepare yourself for anything.

Ive been with my SO for 10 yrs now  and for a while ive been very passive with her controlling behavior but  its worked out. shes always been opinionated, and spoke freely but has  always been aggressive and controlling with everything. Over the last  recent year or so its started to get to me and i often have flashbacks  of things shes done that have been red flags over the years and i resent  her for it alot. She notices but i feel so deep in it now i dont even  argue or talk about things anymore. i just shutdown and go on with my  day while she seethes on her own.\n\nA  little background: we moved cross country and have a toddler now. We've  been through alot together but now that i'm having realizations about  our past i notice most of the hard work or problems were put on me to  handle. Shes told me not to hang out with people because they treat me  like a door mat. Talks about how my family is always talking down to me  and blames everything and everyone else for our problems. I've been  shown warning signs and people have also told me about these things in  the past and i chose to stay.\n\nRecently  weve been having alot of fights because I tell her that shes not  pulling her weight. She hasnt worked in a few years, she doesnt drive,  barely cleans, doesnt do her own laundry, hasnt contributed to bills for  years and wants to travel all the time. she does find things on market  place that are nice but i always mention if she worked we would have  more $ in the bank. I dont want to keep bad mouthing as im hoping for a  unbiased opinion though i think i havent done well in creating that.\n\nanyway i can keep going on more but want to get to the point.\n\nNow  we just had a argument because she wants to travel for some free stay  IHG timeshare. (Ironically when she was getting hooked by the sales  person about 2 year ago i insisted on not taking the deal because it  wasnt financially feasible with a baby on the way. she did it anyway and  ofcourse that was a fight). anyway fast forward the time has come up to  book this trip or we will lose out on $200.\n\nWe  literally just took a trip 2 weeks ago that cost me a little over $1000  considering travel expenses and all that. Traveling is so annoying with  her. She is a late packer and late waker upper, always needs things and  over packs and always forgets things too. I known this from previous  travels and i always get anxious cause of these things because they  always happen without falter. Now with a kid its more annoying. She  always gets angry cause im upset when we travel and says i get angry and  anxious. I tell her everyone does but she makes me very anxious due to  these things.\n\nSometimes i wish i  can travel without her honestly. anyway since i foot the bill everything  falls on me, mind you i dont have a great job, just enough to get us by  and have a little extra. she doesnt drive either so im chauffeur  everytime and because of her tardiness im babysitting most mornings.  Also we have dogs! guess who takes the dogs out and feeds them every  day.\n\nAnyway, point is I dont want  to go. I made it clear it was going to cost too much with the flight,  car rental, food and whatever else we choose to do. Also the pet care we  would need because of flying out. The stress of thinking of all this  has automatically put me in a NO especially cause again im paying, im  driving. she wanted to sit down and talk about how much it would cost  and making a plan but i told her I dont like travelling with her and I  didnt want to spend over a grand again on a trip when we just took one. I  would love to go but the truth is the idea of traveling with her is a  nightmare especially after this last time, i told myself i wouldnt do it  again.\n\nI dont know what to do or  say now. She is mad at me and told me were going to lose our 200 but i  really dont care, its worth it to me. shes very upset and isnt talking  but im so used to it im not bothered. I think im at my end of the rope  with this and its heartbreaking but im just zombie mode because i love  my kid. Ill live miserable as long as i can raise my child but i dont  think thats healthy.\n\nTLDR: Wife  wants to travel or well lose money. Just took trip that cost over a  grand and this one will too even though its months away. Travelling with  her drives me crazy and makes me anxious i dont enjopy travel at all. I  foot the bills, I drive, I physically make things happen while shutting  up. Shes controlling and like to use it to guilt trip me but ive had  enough and now she doesnt want to speak and we resent eachother.\n\nhave a kid and will stay miserable as long as im here for my child.\n\nI  dont know how to leave or talk about these things. I feel theres no  fixing at this point so im just  begrudgingly moving through life for my  child.\n\nI dont know how to tell  her i dont want to do this trip either as i know she is going to keep  bringing it up and getting mad at me.\n\nany advice on any of this is welcome.

I feel theres no  fixing at this point so im just  begrudgingly moving through life for my  child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dont know how to tell  her i dont want to do this trip either as i know she is going to keep  bringing it up and getting mad at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;any advice on any of this is welcome. I know whats going on but its hard to make moves when you have nobody to speak to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

  "body": "My life is falling apart and I've got no one to talk to about it.\n\nMy life is quite literally falling apart in front of my eyes.\n\nI'm 34M married to a beautiful 41F for coming up to 4 years this year and nearly 7 years together.\n\nI love this woman more than she would ever know. (she doesn't feel like I do)\n\nA bit of backstory into me, I was an undiagnosed ADHDer living and struggling with life throughout my life until meeting her. She made me see that there is something not right with me and so 2 year's ago I decided to go seek help and understand myself more about why I am a colossal f*ck up that can't hold a job down, fails with finances, fails with an intimacy beyond the initial stage, fails at showing up on time and various other issues.\n\nA year later I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, plus for me, I can start to understand myself more and put the right stuff in place to help me manage a bearable life. That was December. 3 weeks ago I started medication however I'm not seeing any benefit yet. \n\nI and I didn't have the best of starts in a relationship, I was a tremendous dick and wasn't considerate at all.\n\nI struggle with long stained periods with someone, anyone I'm not I'm notalkitalkinga relationship with. I stop talking, I'm in the present person and struggle with starting conversations about anything that's not happening right now or wasn't that long ago and even that is a struggle remembering stuff to talk about. The conversation doesn't even start because it's one-sided.\n\nEven when she doesn't talk to me I struggle to remember the details and previous conversations which makes it seem like I don't give a shit but I do, I do. That I now know it's because of ADHD but she says that I am now just using that as an excuse for everything. I'm not, that wasn't the goal, the goal was to understand why I am the way I am and to get help on coping methods to make this all somewhat better. But she should understand this as her son is a dud and autistic, I'm pretty sure I am autistic too but that's a different path to get a diagnosis as an adult something I have tried to get a referral for but doc refused first time waiting on a report from the adhd. Need to follow up on that.\n\nWe rarely share the same bed, her daughter who is 9 sleeps with her (stepdad) we would have thought she would be out by now. (she had cancer at the age of 5 I know things changed psychology before my wife and her during that time)\n\nBut that's the time when I open up more and become more intimate. We had great sex at the beginning. It's not about that though I just want her back.\n\nShe has a fair deal of issues, she has an extensive list of meds she takes for various conditions. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit I let her advance in her career she wanted to become a counselor, so she took the training and got promoted in her current workplace and now works with children as a counselor around our school district. I as result became more of a house husband, that is trying to break through in the online space and work from home to be here for her kids as a much as possible. I fail at that too but I can understand why now, I made some decent money during 2020 online but the business partner then had a life breakdown of his own and started scamming people behind my back using the brand, that business obviously came crashing down fast and I've struggled mentally and physically to get past that and procrastinated a lot because of that. \n\nShe ended up needing to take a second job to bring in some more cash, 3 days a week in an evening as a texted based counselor online from home 3hrs a night. \n\nI took up driving for takeaways to bring in some cash whilst I build up the business that still isn't producing cash. That job means I'm out of the house 5-6 nights a week for 6-7 hours. Meaning I get home around 12 - 1am need to get to sleep and be up for 7-7.30 to sort the kids out. I pretty much leave when she gets home they might be an hour or two before I go. \n\nI struggle with the general house work as every adhder does, the house needs decorating and fixing up, she's been on my case about that for year's, I've slowly started now though. It's slow because that takes up so much of my mental cappicatiy. The house isn't the best at times, a bit messy when I've proitised other things and stuff. I need a \"lazy day\" at times, where I'm pretty much dead and I get the bear min done, a quick vac, pots and cat litter tray cleaned along with getting the kids to school and back.\n\nThat winds her up like nothing else but to me it's needed.\n\nI used to not be able to control my anger when we'd get into arguments but I never hit her or anything like that. Just shout and slam doors but that's controlled now I haven't done that in a while maybe the odd flair up but nothing major.\n\nIt's done more of a 180 she swears and gets angry at me more now than the other way round.\n\nHer daughter is really stubborn, and I struggle at times to get her to do what is needed, my wife struggles with this too. I don't raise my voice at her because she just shuts down completely and I get your not my dad. Which is fair enough but it has meant she's been late to school and not attended at times where we are now on school attendance monitoring. It's getting better with that in place. I don't want her to suffer and I don't want my wife to get the stick for it when its her that has to go to work and pay the bills for which I'm enterally grateful for.\n\nWe had a report to social services from school because one of the daughters friends that used to come round to the house made an accusation, that my wife has been sending inappropriate images to another man and receiving them and she has seen them.\n\nObviously my wife denies this and I have no question of whether that's the truth or not that happened last Wednesday, when the said kid was supposed to be coming to ours after school but decided to run off from school before pick up time. My wife had previously said she's not allowed at our house anymore but she's said stuff like that before and has never meant it. I thought the daughter had arranged this with her mum but as it turns out not. We didn't really see each other between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. I was working everyone was asleep when I returned.\n\nI didn't even know myself until we got to school when the daughter told me about her coming. So I just went with it because she would have refused to move if I said anything otherwise. Stubborn. \n\nThis is all my fault apparently but before that Tuesday my wife came home visibly upset and fed up with everything, she spent 30 mins in the car before even stepping inside the house clearly had been crying. I tried asking her about it, I got \"I'm fine\" over and over again I had to leave for work.\n\nSince the she's avoided me and her daughter pretty as much as possible.\n\nWednesday night she locked herself in with her son and slept with him instead. Thursday she went to her friends house and came home only when I needed to leave. And Friday we had opticians for the whole family, it was hard, the daughter kicked off 3 times, 2 of the times I was the one to calm her down. After we dropped her off at her days where she was crying as she went in the house not talking or saying bye to her mum. \n\nWe got home and I had an usual Friday off, I really wanted to try repair this but she had other plans and got dressed up and went out to another friend's house and took alchol with her and didn't return home after 2am. I'm not sure how much she had to drink but she drove home and with her meds its really unpredictable how it affects her sometimes she's drunk after only a few. I was asleep. Her daughter came home at around 9pm confused to why her mother wasn't here to which I had to play with her and be with her until she was asleep. I didn't mind but it was hard when this is all going on.\n\nNow she's in her sons room again today, but I think she's asleep and struggling with her chronic fatigue.\n\nThat's not all of it, but you get a picture.\n\nI love this girl, I find her incredibly hot, I miss the intimacy and I just want her to be happier most of all. \n\nI see it all falling apart and I have no one to talk too about it.\n\nI ditched my friends because they wasn't being supportive and I would have stayed being that dick I was at the start. \n\nI've distanced myself away from my family because of other issues.\n\nAnd my wife thinks I'm just like her exes, out to make her life miserable and cause problems in her life.\n\nWhen it's the opposite I do all I can to change and better myself. But I have my struggles and limitations. \n\nI needed to write out.",

  "body": "A few weeks ago, i (23 f) got in a pretty bad car accident. I was lucky to walk away with a fractured collarbone and a few scrapes. My husband (24 m) took a week off of work to help me and to be honest, by the end I was very upset with how he cared for me. \n\nIt is important to note that me and my husband separated 5 months ago and have been actively working on our relationship during this time. We also have a 1 and a half year old that was going to daycare during the days.\n\n\nThe things that i needed help with included sitting up, going to the bathroom, getting food/water/medicine, and helping with the baby in the evenings and mornings.\n\nWhere i got upset was that he started to get frustrated with me over simple things like needing to go to the bathroom. On one occasion, he left me in the bathtub all alone and went to bed and \"accidentally\" fell asleep. That night, i had to try to put my own clothes on and was in extreme pain. He blamed me for taking a bath too late at night (it was about 8:30), and so the next day i decided to take my bath earlier (like 5:30) we put my daughter in the tub with me and while in the middle of the bath he declared that his mom was there to go grocery shopping with him. He said that he had to leave right away and didn't have time to help me. I asked how long he would be gone, and he told me not long and left. The grocery store is 5 minutes away, and they were only grabbing a few things, so i waited 30 minutes before having to get myself and my toddler out of the bath and dressed. When he got home 1 hour later i asked what the deal was and he said that him and his mom got to talking and thats why he got back so late.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back for me though was that one night, in the second week of my recovery my daughter had made a mess on the bed and the sheets had to be washed. The sheets got washed and were dry and in the room but not back on the bed. He was complaining that he needed some alone time. I was giving him space when our daughter woke up after putting her down for the night. To try and be nice i used my one good arm to lift her out of her crib and onto the bed. I layed down with her until she calmed down and went back to sleep. A while later he came into the room and said \"you've got to be kidding me! The sheets aren't on the bed!\"  Then he turned to me and said \"(my name) would you ever put your head down on your pillow without a pillowcase?!\" I felt really hurt since i was trying to do something nice only to get chewed out for something i had no control over nor the ability to do.\n\nHe took the first week off of work. I stayed there for one more week so he could drop me off at work since i didn't have a car. After that, I went back to my grandma's house so I could get the help i needed without the resentment. \n\nI am ready to call off our whole relationship over this but he swears up and down that i am just being ridiculous. Were my expectations wrong? Was i expecting too much from him? I really need a reality check because i can not tell if i really am being selfish or if he is gaslighting me.\n\nTLDR: my husband took a week off of work and helped me for one week after that while i was recovering from a broken collarbone. He complained about me a lot during that time and pit me in bad situations. Should i just be greatful or is my frustration justified?",

Idk I'm just actually worried and scared of leaving her...\n\nI've been dating this girl for about 6 months and she really seemed like a unique character. Really smart and funny. And she seemed like a good person. Donates money, helps at animal shelters and she even gave my cousin a job when she lost hers.\n\nBut I was beginning to question it. It started with little things. Like I showed her a picture of my friends new bf and it was a black guy. She looks at picture and asks me if my friend has a dad. And I said no and she just shrugged her shoulders and kept eating. Hit me later it might be racism.\n\nAnother thing, this couple that lives across the street from one of her parents' businesses yelled at her for always parking on the sidewalk even tho admittedly no one uses it. They said they're gonna start reporting her. Now this couple has a disabled son and they built an outside lift thing on the side of their house for him. The next morning I found out they got fined for having it put up and had to take it down.\n\nI ask her if she reported it and she just said hey I was worried about the kid, what if it wasn't built properly. \n\nAnd just this week something really weird happened. This guy has been complimenting me at the gym. I told him I'm taken but he keeps doing it, he's married. I randomly mentioned this to my gf. And she just kinda gave me the side-eye. And yesterday I see her Instagram following jump from 40 to 41. Weird because she never uses insta, has a private account and only has 1 picture. \n\nFound out she followed the guy's wife. I ask her about it she says they started a conversation at a coffee shop randomly and started talking. Has nothing to do with the guy... I ask her if she'll tell her about his actions she says no. I ask her if she's gonna hook up with her and she says fuck no wtf is wrong with you can't I have friends...\n\nAnd I just know she's plotting something.

He‘s really patient with me, loyal, communicative, supportive - basically treats me like a princess - very funny, emotionally intelligent etc. etc. His family is also great and we have all have a close relationship. \n\nabout two years ago I was dating my ex boyfriend, let‘s call him John(28m). We started dating at the beginning of corona, met through tinder. When we met something in me just clicked and I fell in love fast and hard. I wanted to be with him forever. I thought John was perfect in every way and the first 3 months were amazing. Then it slowly started to become rocky. John got angry pretty quickly, threw things around his room, yelled, also kicked in a door right next to me. I was always hoping that it was just a phase, but it didn‘t get better. Afterwards he would always apologize and we‘d reconcile. I was constantly triggered around him. Sounds like the basic toxic relationship right?\n\nWell, my current boyfriend worked really hard on gaining my trust and helped me heal. And since John and I haven‘t seen each other for more than a year, I thought everything would be fine again. BUT NOPE. I saw him an hour ago (accidentally), we talked and I felt all those butterflies again. He was so beautiful to me, I don‘t even wanna go into detail how I felt about him but - what do i do now?\n\nI wish I could feel that way about my current bf :( it‘s so unfair to him and I really don‘t want to feel that way about John…\nWhy do I feel that way? How should I deal with that situation?   \n\ntl;dr: still have feelings for emotionally abusive ex bf, even though im in a happy healthy relationship",

  "body": "TLDR: as the title says, it's been over a year and I'm still struggling to accept this is real.\n\nLet me explain the situation. This happenned a little over a year ago. Me and my gf had a rough patch at the time and we were broken up for a few weeks.\n\nDuring this time a friend had a small scale house party with a few people and both of us were invited. She gets drunk easily and that's exactly what happenned. I felt like we got along pretty well and everything seemed to be alright, but then something happenned.\n\nA few hours into the party the other guys were outside, I was in the dining room playing on my phone and my best friend and my at the time ex gf were in a room together next to the dining room. I heard sounds and I was sure they were making out. At that moment my world crumbled, I couldn't feel anything. I wanted to go in and beat him but for some reason I couldn't do anything, I just sat there and listened. \n\nShortly after that I went outside, said goodbye to the guys there and left.\n\nThe next week I was super frustrated and just snapped at them (we are all classmates).

This happenned a little over a year ago. Me and my gf had a rough patch at the time and we were broken up for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During this time a friend had a small scale house party with a few people and both of us were invited. She gets drunk easily and that&amp;#39;s exactly what happenned. I felt like we got along pretty well and everything seemed to be alright, but then something happenned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few hours into the party the other guys were outside, I was in the dining room playing on my phone and my best friend and my at the time ex gf were in a room together next to the dining room. I heard sounds and I was sure they were making out. At that moment my world crumbled, I couldn&amp;#39;t feel anything. I wanted to go in and beat him but for some reason I couldn&amp;#39;t do anything, I just sat there and listened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that I went outside, said goodbye to the guys there and left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next week I was super frustrated and just snapped at them (we are all classmates). I told them both how much this hurt me and also said some really nasty things which I regret. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this incident all my friends resented me and sided with my gf because they said how I acted was unacceptable which is kind of fair thb. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We still argued about what happenned with my gf and it turned out that they weren&amp;#39;t only making out but also had sex.

Not a kiss or even a hug, or even a \"welcome home\", nothing... \n\nToday we were talking about kids a bit, we have one child together already and we want more down the line, however the illness I was hospitalised for, may leave me infertil, so we talked a bit about other options and such. He says he wants to adopt one at our child's age  because the first time is stressful, I mention I like the first time and that when you adopt, it's typically infants or slightly older anyways and he literally told me \"then you can take care of it yourself\" and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I was alone about taking care of our kid for the first 6 months, but I suspected that my husband might have had a bit of PPD, so I did what I could. But now it sounds like that's exactly what I can expect again, and I just don't wanna deal with it anymore. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI know about all the legal steps to take, but how do you even start that conversation? What do you say?",

  "parsedCommunityName": "relationship_advice",
  "body": "My boyfriend and I have had a great relationship together for over three months. I will admit we may have moved very fast into a relationship after knowing each other for about two weeks and saying \"I love you\" to each other the day we became official. It's crazy I know. We just spent those weeks getting to know each other so well and were both very open about communicating everything. Before we got together, my boyfriend expressed some hesitation, because he didn't think he would get into a relationship in college and really values his alone time. I didn't think much of the alone time part, because I like my alone time as well. But this has become our only issue in the relationship. We communicate well, have amazing intimacy, and love each other. I think with him having been in a relationship before I thought he would be more comfortable with initiating, spending time together, and other relationship things, so I had a base line expectation of for a relationship, but this is my first relationship so I was mainly guessing. I am usually the one initiating things, so when it's me mostly asking to hang out, then a lot of the time I have to tweak my initial proposal to what he's comfortable with. It mainly feels that we only do things on his time and what he's wants, because he wants to get work done, read, or just simply be alone. I expressed this to him and he was understanding of it and didn't realize that it came off that way. We mostly only spend alone time together towards later into the night. His preference is to come over past 7pm and leave around 12-2am, and we on average spend one day a week together hanging out. We have a class together, and he likes to say since we have class together twice a week then we are spending time together. I don't really view it that way, like it's nice to see him during that time, but we can't really talk during class. We talk after for about 10 minutes as I walk him towards his car during my two hour class break, but it's not what I consider spending time together, but maybe I view it wrong. We text almost everyday but there isn't really any consistent morning or night check-ins, and we don't really facetime or call often, unless I am the one doing it. He's really bad at responding, because he puts his phone on do not disturb a lot to stay off his phone. He also has ADHD, so he gets distracted often. And I just to be understanding that he does have ADHD, but it doesn't seem like he's trying to work on it to remember to text me back, and he reminds me that his house is chaotic with his roomates. He said that he has sacrificed a lot of his alone time, that I'm his number 1 person in his life, he talks to me more than his best friend who lives in his home state, and that he wouldn't have dated me if I wasn't special. He tells me this, but it doesn't make me feel any better, because if I was that important, why can't he give me more and what he knows I deserve. I think he's at the point where he's not willing to give me more. He says he reluctant to initiate, because I find it hard when he leaves or I have to leave, and I usually ask to him to stay a little longer. Then, he states we've spent this many hours together, we see each other in class, and we'll hang out sometime soon (which is whenever I initiate again). I am the type of person who thinks that tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so I don't find the last part as reassuring as he does. To him, it should feel enough. He dated me, thinking that I would be comfortable with this and this would be enough. I try to savor and prolong the time we spend together, because I feel like we don't get enough time together. But he sees me getting sad or disappointed, so he feels reluctant to ask to hang out to prevent me getting sad, but I get even more sad when I feel like I'm waiting for his attention. We've talked about our time issue many times, but we haven't been able to resolve it. But we are just now trying to really think about solutions. It's almost like a losing situation. I get more time. He's not happy because he can't have his alone time. He doesn't give me more time. I'm not happy feeling like I'm waiting around for his time and attention. I don't want to give up, but I have no idea how to solve this. Please I need some advice on whether I am asking too much, is this salvageable, or any tips on how to solve issues in a relationship. Thanks!",

His preference is to come over past 7pm and leave around 12-2am, and we on average spend one day a week together hanging out. We have a class together, and he likes to say since we have class together twice a week then we are spending time together. I don&amp;#39;t really view it that way, like it&amp;#39;s nice to see him during that time, but we can&amp;#39;t really talk during class. We talk after for about 10 minutes as I walk him towards his car during my two hour class break, but it&amp;#39;s not what I consider spending time together, but maybe I view it wrong. We text almost everyday but there isn&amp;#39;t really any consistent morning or night check-ins, and we don&amp;#39;t really facetime or call often, unless I am the one doing it. He&amp;#39;s really bad at responding, because he puts his phone on do not disturb a lot to stay off his phone. He also has ADHD, so he gets distracted often. And I just to be understanding that he does have ADHD, but it doesn&amp;#39;t seem like he&amp;#39;s trying to work on it to remember to text me back, and he reminds me that his house is chaotic with his roomates. He said that he has sacrificed a lot of his alone time, that I&amp;#39;m his number 1 person in his life, he talks to me more than his best friend who lives in his home state, and that he wouldn&amp;#39;t have dated me if I wasn&amp;#39;t special. He tells me this, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel any better, because if I was that important, why can&amp;#39;t he give me more and what he knows I deserve. I think he&amp;#39;s at the point where he&amp;#39;s not willing to give me more. He says he reluctant to initiate, because I find it hard when he leaves or I have to leave, and I usually ask to him to stay a little longer. Then, he states we&amp;#39;ve spent this many hours together, we see each other in class, and we&amp;#39;ll hang out sometime soon (which is whenever I initiate again). I am the type of person who thinks that tomorrow isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed, so I don&amp;#39;t find the last part as reassuring as he does. To him, it should feel enough. He dated me, thinking that I would be comfortable with this and this would be enough. I try to savor and prolong the time we spend together, because I feel like we don&amp;#39;t get enough time together. But he sees me getting sad or disappointed, so he feels reluctant to ask to hang out to prevent me getting sad, but I get even more sad when I feel like I&amp;#39;m waiting for his attention. We&amp;#39;ve talked about our time issue many times, but we haven&amp;#39;t been able to resolve it. But we are just now trying to really think about solutions. It&amp;#39;s almost like a losing situation. I get more time. He&amp;#39;s not happy because he can&amp;#39;t have his alone time. He doesn&amp;#39;t give me more time. I&amp;#39;m not happy feeling like I&amp;#39;m waiting around for his time and attention. I don&amp;#39;t want to give up, but I have no idea how to solve this. Please I need some advice on whether I am asking too much, is this salvageable, or any tips on how to solve issues in a relationship. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Today my girlfriend got angry over some small issue and broke up with me and told me not to come outside her house and beg .The issue is not that she said those words the real issue is i don't know why i get so desperate In relationships. Before this relationship few years back i was in a relationship with another girl for almost 2 years . What i have noticed is i get too desperate too fast.i have noticed that everytime my current  girl over even in the past with my ex tried to break up with me i just can't take it even if i know it's not really a break up i also get these feelings like what to do now ? , What will happen to me ? ,I can't without her , i need to call her . Then i cry and beg her not to leave me . If she blocks me i go outside her house then we make it up. I dont know why i am like this and what i should do to  stopbeing so desperate and weak when i fall in love . The girl that i am dating currently is a very nice girl  but i feel now that she is taking me for granted and it's my own fault for being like this .she wasn't like this before i started being needy and emotional and desperate . The situation right now is i don't think she even respects me that's why in anger she wrote not to come begging outside her house . I know she also loves me a lot but i feel my own desperate attitude is eventually making her lose respect for me because she wasn't like this until i slowly became desperate. In the previous relationship also my ex left me because i was like this . Please suggest on what should I do .",

I am really happy with our relationship, but we’ve recently hit a rough patch and I really don’t know who to turn to to ask about this. My boyfriend lives at home while he goes to school, like myself, and also works. He doesn’t pay rent because his parents haven’t asked he do it, but he does pay other bills for the household such as light and the phone bills. He doesn’t make much but he tries his best. His parents were always neglectful towards him growing up and treated him like a stranger - often forgetting he even existed and prioritizing his siblings. His room is not insulated so it’s always cold, no windows and they don’t even allow him to cook there or have their water; he has to get his own.

There’s not much I can really do besides send him some cash when I can; I feel horrible.\n\nTwo days ago, they kicked him out after he couldn’t afford to pay one of the bills that month. He’d spent a majority of his check on water and groceries. He’s been bunking with a friend and I still feel so horrible that I can’t take him in. He’s been talking to me about enlisting in the military because he didn’t really have any other options prior to being kicked out and I’ve always said I didn’t agree.

During those years we had ups and downs in our relationship but we always managed to talk it through with me starting conversation.She usually blocked me after argument but I think that’s because her mother told her so. We spend lust summer all together and I was seriously thinking about proposing to her in the future. when we were together we were happiest people alive. We planned to rent sth and move together for collage, but my grandma needed my help after surgery so I moved to her instead. My girlfriend moved to her friends house. Since then she was constantly pushing through topic of living together. To be clear I really wanted to live with her but since I started collage everything my life started falling apart and I was diagnosed with depression. I was stressed with my collage, my parents company which started to go bankrupt and my father’s mental health. He developed depression and had suicidal thoughts. I was stressed by everything that was happening in my live and I didn’t want to tell anyone about it even my dearest girlfriend. I started collapsing and close myself for others. During time I was alone I was smoking marihuana to stop thinking about everything and be happy. I started getting annoyed with every text from her and really thought about ending this relationship. But every time that we met I couldn’t push myself to do it. She cared for me and loved me with all her heart. She is smart so she noticed that sth was bothering me but I never told her. I didn’t want to tell anyone. 3 months ago she decided to go to a club with her friend (20 F) and had some fun. Nothing serious just she spent a night with her but I didn’t know that at that time. When I found out ( the next day) in a state of rage at her I went out with my friend (20 F) that she was jealous. Nothing serious I just wanted to talk with her and I told her (my gf) many times that she is only my friend. She (friend) told her that too. We were meeting like once a month or two, for few hours so it wasn’t a big deal for me, but I wanted to make her jealous. I know it was stupid but that’s what I did. During meeting I wrote to my gf that I met up with her because I felt guilty. After that she stopped replying to my texts and after 2 days with no contact she broke up with me and blocked me on every social media. I tried to give her space but I really missed her and after a week I drove 1000 km in hope to see her during her championship. I wanted to tell her how much I care and love her. Unfortunately she stayed in her hotel room refusing to talk to me. So I came back home. Since then I tried many times contacting with her and her family and every time that I asked I got the answers like “if you really care for her give her time” or “I’m can’t tell you yet what I feel to you”. When I met her like month ago I told her everything I struggled with and asked her if she wants me to fight for our relationship or no. she told me that she can’t tell me that yet. I apologized to her for the fact that my actions made her feel bad and I reassured her of how much I love and care for her. \nI left my phone for her so she could red all my messages if wanted but she didn’t even bother to open it. She just drove to my parents and gave them my phone. \n\nIt’s been 3 months and I really miss her.\nIm in rage and don’t know what to do. \nI know that her mother don’t like me much and she is confining my gf that it’s the bad idea to talk to me and reassures her how important is her work and passion and that I’m the reason for her every fail. I know for sure that she is as hurt as I am and that she misses me. \nSince then I started working out and “fixed” my life. I can’t stop thinking about her. \nIt’s the worst feeling ever. I don’t want to move on and start new relationship. I want to fight for her but I really don’t know how.",
