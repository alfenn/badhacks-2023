    "prompt": "M25(me)/F39(wife) when is enough I’ve tried to write this a few times but here we go. We met 4 years ago and we both worked at a grocery store as assistant department managers. I being a very young naive person when I met her has grown up a lot, but I’ve always had a problem working with significant others at work due to seeing them too much and having either life or work spill into the other so we don’t work together anymore. \n\nWe got married a year and half ago. The first year was rough(due to me being very resistant to change)We moved to a different state and bought a house and we both had decent jobs at the time but our first issue arose. Before we got married we had separate accounts but with the marriage we just combined everything. This became and issue for my wife and really created a-lot of resentment between the both of us(this is a lot better now)My resentment was due to my feelings of being over worked and under appreciated for the things I actually do. I do 70% of the work in and on the house. Cook and do 50% of the cleaning. I also bring in 75% of our total money from working two jobs. My wife used to bring in 50% of the money but when we moved she felt overwhelmed so she basically waited until a month before she quit to tell me she didn’t want to work there anymore. We’ve worked in the same industry for years and I understand it is a-lot and very demanding but I told her to wait to find an opportunity that will bring in the same amount of money but she left that job and found another job that paid half of her previous job(still currently)I was of course frustrated beyond belief only for the fact that my wife couldn’t convince that by her leaving her job that if we wanted to maintain the life we had, I would have to step up even more and bring in more money so we could live like we’re used to. But I bite my tongue as much as I could but she just kept asking me everyday for months how I felt about it. And eventually it started to boil over. How can I possibly feel differently if I have no time to think about it and truly accept it. This went on for months and we had extremely heated arguments without really seeing any real change. No matter what is said the situation sucked and I wasn’t going to change the way I felt about the situation but I made the choice everyday to ignore how I felt to make sure my wife was alright. Well maybe not the right choice because I lost bits of myself every time we would argue and I had to make a permanent change to my mind frame . \n\nI am not a perfect person and I have problems but I have spent the last 6 months truly looking at myself and seeing where I was the problem and trying to fix my thought processes to become a better person. I’ve come so far on myself but I still have a lot of room to grow but I’m better than last year. The more I work on myself I see the actions that my wife takes and I can’t agree with the way she acts anymore. She’s been hurt too much and has way to many insecurities for me as a single person to help her and keep the life that now I’m supporting. It’s too much. I’m 25 and still figuring out how things work and it takes a toll on me everyday but I’ve found ways to keep myself motivated and keep going. Until last night. \n\nMy wife texted me because she got her schedule for work and she has Valentine’s Day off(which she didn’t request off). She asked if I had Valentine’s Day off and I said no I didn’t. I’m a department manager now and I have responsibilities around holidays because I work in grocery stores and I don’t get any holidays off besides thanksgiving and Christmas which is understood but now that my wife has holidays off now and expects me to have these holidays off to spend with her which is fine if I can make it work but it doesn’t always work out. Anyways she made a couple light hearted jokes when she was at work after I told her I count get the day off but then we she got in the door from work I was cooking Dinner and she blew up on me. She’s threatened now twice to go into work and make a scene just so I could get certain days off. She threatens me with divorce maybe once a month and to take half of all my shit. I understand you say things in the heat of the moment but I don’t see how you can share a bed with someone who just told you we should get divorced and I’m taking half your shit. \n\nI’m to the point where I was researching narcissism and I thought it was all my fault but the more time that passes and the more actions I fix of my own the more I’m left with the reality that it’s not all my fault. I can’t even exist without a word coming out her mouth about whatever I’m doing.  If anyone has questions I’m more than happy to explain further in comments. There is still hope I’m just at my wits end right now. I’m tired and I just want to be left alone to do my own thing. \n\nI just feel defeated and tired. I don’t know what to do. Is it worth the effort to make work. I’m young and in shape and my wife hasn’t worked out in two years  and has gained a good 30 pounds and she’s been dealing with this rash but simple to say I’m not attracted to her like I used to be. She doesn’t put in the effort to work on her self and I’ve seen no real change in anything, yet she keeps asking for more. More time, more love and affection. She wants the house fixed up and she wants to go on vacation which is fine but to Spain for a family wedding on my side. It will cost probably 2k for the whole trip which is doable but it takes up a good chunk of our savings so it stresses me out. She wants all this stuff but is unwilling to help me at all. I just have to figure it out. But after last night I don’t even want to look at her. I feel helpless. I’m done changing and making myself better to have to share that with someone who will not do the same for me",
    "completion": "One, google defensiveness in relationships. Defensiveness is often found when someone is insecure, it can get confused with narcissism (as narcs are often defensive) and defensiveness is way more common than narcissism.\n\nAs for the relationship, the age difference, her demanding more and giving so little, the possible defensiveness or narcissism, no one would fault you for getting a divorce. Maybe before that get some therapy for yourself to help you better unpack what’s going on and how you feel about it. From there you’ll be better able to decide if it’s worth trying to fix or if it’s best to call it quits."

When I came home, I couldn't find my dog anywhere. I asked him where she was and he said he took her outside for her to pee and that was the last he saw her. I had dog missing signs and my friends and shelters trying to find her but my boyfriend isn't of any help. He wasn't watching the dog closely and even tells me to move on and get a cat or something.\n\nI don't think my boyfriend is taking any of this seriously. How do I get him to realize that my dog is important?",

A good therapist is a great resource- they can practically run simulations in their brains to provide feedback on directions you can go and predict outcomes because they've seen / heard just about everything. \n\nI highly recommend doing as little as possible with communicating with him right now- you have children, so you have to manage best interests of the children, and that includes having their father be in their lives with visitation.  But you don't have to talk about your relationship or anything about you, you can leave if he comes to your house or insist he takes the kiddos to McDonalds.  \n\nSometimes space gives people perspective, time to simmer down.  This time period might give you both time to try on what being separated feels / looks like.  It may also give him time to reflect on what having 50% access to his children and 0% access to you feels like and vice versa if you're thinking about separation.\n\nDuring this time, you should also research adoption- look at the legal process, research other people's experiences with familial adoptions to gauge how you'll feel before/during/after, get an understanding if SIL REALLY desires this child for her own reasons- or is just willing to take on the responsibility.  If your SIL truly desires to adopt this child for her own reasons, your husband hearing that from her might help.  \n\nThis is big.  This won't all happen overnight, take some time and marinate before you try to solve this.  I hope this helps, or leads you to another resource that helps."

She is always scrolling through it all throughout the day ever single day. We have had disagreements stemming from tik tok in the past in regards to other issues so needless to say I am not the biggest fan of the app. I deleted my account and deleted the app since I was just over it.\n\nAnyways a little background since I met my girlfriend she has always been on top of social issues to say lightly. Anyways as our relationship progressed we got more comfortable with each other I feel like she has been more controlling. \n\nMy girlfriend sees things on tik tok about what has a person place or thing is getting canceled on tik tok and tells me not to listen to that artist, wear a specific brand of clothes, or what restaurant I can not eat at or what tv shows don’t want. It is a lot so sometimes it is hard to remember everything. My whole gripe is once the tik tok cycle is over she forgets anything happened and goes back to also listening to said person which I find is really weird because I feel like she is only canceling someone because of what tik tok told her to do. \n\nThis has been so exhausting because it’s feels like it weekly a new person place or thing she doesn’t want me to partake in because of tik tok cancel culture. It is extreme to the point where I feel anxious about listening to my playlist in the car because if a person she canceled comes up it will bother her which I have zero knowledge about. There has been arguments in the past where an artist comes on I had zero idea she canceled him and she gets upset if it is played. And this is just the tip of the ice berg. \n\nIt really does stress me out because I have brought it up to her to stop demanding me to stop doing things. I asked her if the least she could do was ask me but she did it again recently. \n\nI do not know what to do",

What am I supposed to do now? We met in high school &amp; have been together for 6 years. I’ve always been overweight but when we met I was at the healthiest I’ve ever been. I still wore XL clothes but I was overall fairly fit and I exercised regularly. After our relationship got serious we moved in together and I picked up his unhealthy habits. We were eating almost identical shitty diets, but I gained a lot of weight and he only gained a little. Now I wear 3x clothes and it’s been impossible for me to prioritize my health because I have a lot more responsibilities and obligations than I did 6 years ago (btw since then I’ve been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder which explains why I gained weight so easily.) He insinuated he doesn’t even like to look at me anymore and I have noticed he has been treating me differently. I still enjoy going out, getting active, and doing activities but now I’m so embarrassed I don’t even want to leave my house. What do I do?\n\nAdding more context to the post because this got way more attention than I expected: I appreciate the kind comments and advice. I really do want to better myself and I can understand gaining a considerable amount of weight can change a relationship, but he had only ever complimented me, so I didn’t realize it was such as issue for him until yesterday. After he told me how he felt I asked him if he would be willing to take on some household duties so that I could have time to focus on myself (I work, take care of the house, and I’m a full time student with lots of homework) and he was very resistant to the idea. I ask him to join me on my walks (having him with me motivates me to walk faster/longer) but he tells me walking isn’t exercise because he only sweats if he runs.

    "prompt": "Today my (25f) husband(24m) not so nicely told me he isn’t attracted to me anymore and implied a lot of our martial issues would be resolved if I lost weight. What am I supposed to do now? We met in high school &amp; have been together for 6 years. I’ve always been overweight but when we met I was at the healthiest I’ve ever been. I still wore XL clothes but I was overall fairly fit and I exercised regularly. After our relationship got serious we moved in together and I picked up his unhealthy habits. We were eating almost identical shitty diets, but I gained a lot of weight and he only gained a little. Now I wear 3x clothes and it’s been impossible for me to prioritize my health because I have a lot more responsibilities and obligations than I did 6 years ago (btw since then I’ve been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder which explains why I gained weight so easily.) He insinuated he doesn’t even like to look at me anymore and I have noticed he has been treating me differently. I still enjoy going out, getting active, and doing activities but now I’m so embarrassed I don’t even want to leave my house. What do I do?\n\nAdding more context to the post because this got way more attention than I expected: I appreciate the kind comments and advice. I really do want to better myself and I can understand gaining a considerable amount of weight can change a relationship, but he had only ever complimented me, so I didn’t realize it was such as issue for him until yesterday. After he told me how he felt I asked him if he would be willing to take on some household duties so that I could have time to focus on myself (I work, take care of the house, and I’m a full time student with lots of homework) and he was very resistant to the idea. I ask him to join me on my walks (having him with me motivates me to walk faster/longer) but he tells me walking isn’t exercise because he only sweats if he runs. I’m really struggling between standing up for myself and being understanding of his preferences and feelings…",
    "completion": "I would recommend getting some medical weight management advice.  In my experience, primary care physicians don't usually do this very well, you should go to a specialized center.\n\nThe reason for you to lose that weight is not to hold on to your husband, but to prevent long-term physical deterioration, such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, arthritis, etc.  \n\nBe the healthiest you can possibly be and live a long and happy life!

    "prompt": "Boyfriend (32M) of six months broke up with Me (34F) over the phone after ghosted me 10 days. His therapist called the cop on me when I went to his apartment to check on him. Boyfriend has depression and ADHD and was on medication for over ten years. He was abusing prescription drugs and alcohol for the past three years. He decided to quit both cold turkey last October. I witnessed his psychosis episode. We were supposed to go on a date that day, on my way to his apartment, he started to text me some weird stuff, he was pretty normal before that day. That day was his third day withdrawal. I stayed with him that night and sent him to the ER the next morning. He was then sent to a mental hospital for three weeks in-patient treatment. He was put on zyprexa this time. He also started addiction talk therapy. Ever since he started his therapy, he started to mention that the therapist suggest him to not be in a relationship in the beginning of recovery. But we still maintained our regular dating routine.\n\nTwo weeks ago, he had mentioned to me that we spent to much time together during the weekend. He ghosted me for ten days after our last date. Finally reached out two days ago to schedule a call for yesterday afternoon. He texted me that there's something I needed to talk to you about. I sensed that he probably will break up with me over the phone. So I texted him that if you are going to break up me, please do it in person. He did not reply. Yesterday afternoon, he called on the scheduled time to break up with me. His words are scripted. It's like someone is telling him what to say. Not the way he would normally talk to me. He said the reason for the break up is that he has too much going on in his life, the timing was not right. He reassured me that its not me or anything I did or said.\n\nI haven't seen him for ten days. He live by himself. His not close to his family, he only have two friends who was not aware his mental health problem. I do not have his family nor friend's contact. I was worried about his wellbeing due to I witnessed his previous psychosis episode. I told him I would go to his apartment to check on him. He told me he couldn't see me in-person. I went anyway.\n\nI went to his apartment and he wouldn't let me in in the beginning. Turned out it was the therapist who instructed him not to let me in. But eventually, he let me in. We were sitting next to each other on the couch. This was 10:00PM. He already took his medication for the day. Someone texted him and then he said you need to leave. I asked who's texting you so late? He said it was his therapist. He started to talk to this female therapist two month ago. I am not sure if she knew I was there with him during his last episode. After the text, she the therapist called him twice, each time is asking him to ask me to leave and tell him to call the cops to remove me. She also texted to ask him to call the cops. He texted her back that we were fine. No need to call the cops. And then the therapist texted I am concerned and I call the cops. If she cooperate, she wouldn't be arrested. He showed me all the texts between him and the therapist. I was shocked that this therapist texted my boyfriend to tell him to break up with me over the phone and instructed him through his conversation during the call when he broke up with me. And instructed and pushed him to call the cops to remove me. But my boyfriend would not and insisted that he wouldn't call the cop. Then the therapist called the cop to remove me. I left after the cop get there, my boyfriend explained everything to the cop, we were just talking. They left.\n\nI will not contact my now ex-boyfriend again.  I want the best for him. I hope he can recover. But this whole situation made me feel like the therapist was manipulating my now ex-boyfriend to break up with me. I am not sure if her behavior is ethical. I remember one time my ex-boyfriend mentioned to me that this therapist said he more than likely had schizophrenia since his mother had it. He said his psychiatrist said he did not have schizophrenia. He said he didn't like the therapist. But what happened now just confused me so much.",

    "completion": "Let's all just be completely honest in this comment section right now..\n\nEven the best performed cosmetic procedure can throw someone off. I mean.. you look at someones face for X number of years and all of a sudden it just different. Even if was attractive, it doesnt look like your partner. \n\nWith that said... confidence in your self and your beauty level does not come from outside perspective. You calling someone beautiful only has a temporary effect. Opposite to that, you calling or inferring unattractiveness can last a bit longer, especially if it's someone who expects that your attracted to them. \n\nSo OP.. I think you should be honest. But in a way that doesnt bring up her attractiveness. But figure out what your intentions for this conversation are. Are you expecting her to go back to her natural state or to just explain your side of things. If it's the former, there is a good chance your going to screw this up so watch your words carefully because you might end up severely hurting her."

Or were you referring to her aggressively groping your genitals?\n\nHere are several sexual and domestic violence resources for men in abusive situations or relationships.\n\n* [1 in 6 is an organization dedicated specifically to helping men and boys who have survived sexual violence](https://1in6.org/). They have a 24/7 chat helpline, educational resources, and weekly chat-based online support groups with a trained facilitator. \n* [Male Survivor is also an organization for male sexual violence survivors](https://malesurvivor.org/).

All of their resources are arranged by age of survivor. They also offer referrals to ISVAs (Independent Sexual Violence Advisors) which are legal advocates who help male survivors navigate the criminal and civil justice systems.\n* [The Mayo Clinic offers a comprehensive safety planning guide for male domestic violence survivors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/domestic-violence-against-men/art-20045149).\n\nI'm worried about you.

    "prompt": "I'm (30M) puzzled with my GF(32F): she planned her entire life with me and I can't see our future together Hi everyone, I’m(30M) being puzzle since a couple of months, I’m gonna try  to summarise in a nutshell the history with my partner (32F).\n\nI   moved countries because I got a job, a couple of months later I met  her  and everything was good, after one year and a couple of months we  moved  together because I got laid off. At that time i was scared that  my money  wouldn’t last and i needed to move back to my country, that  was one of  the reasons why I moved. It my first time sharing an  apartment with a  partner. Since I met her she had a excellent salary  and today i made my  way up in a new job and we are both earning the  same amount. So let’s  say that money is not a problem anymore.\n\nNow   it’s been 3 years together, and I have seen some red flags in our   relationship. Once we discussed about children (I don’t want, she   wanted) then she shifted from wanting to “let’s see in the future”. She   wants to get married and for my is a waste of money and don’t find it   necessary.\n\nOn top of those topics,   which are not tiny, I’ve been felling a lacking of freedom in our   relationship. It’s really difficult for me to say “No” to her. A couple   of times I did it and ended up in a mess (she crying because I didn’t   wanna do what she wanted). One clear example, I’m playing soccer in the   team of the city. One Saturday the team was playing and I was injured,   nevertheless I went there to support the team while my GF was working  on  the house she bought and is renovating. The day before we were  talking  and I said to her that i needed to go because I needed to pull  the plug  for one Saturday (were a lot of weekends in a row that I was  helping her  with her house). The day of the match she called me crying  that I  should be there with her helping and not supporting my team,  that she  can’t do everything alone. After a couple of hours when I came  back home  feeling guilty for taking my time (actually i couldn’t enjoy  the match  because I was thinking about the situation all the time) we  had a long  talk about how she needs my support and I explained her that  I need my  moments of disconnection. She kinda agree. There more  examples but don’t  want to enumerate all of them.\n\nSomehow   I have the feeling if I don’t do what she wants there is going to be a   problem. I was thinking about ending up the relationship but at the  same  time i feel guilty because I will not support her anymore, she has  a  loan to pay, and she is scared of not being able to pay all the  bills  (she has savings, cars and a family that can support her with  money but  she doesn’t want to owe money to anybody she is scared of not  being  economically independent). On the rational side of my mind I  know she  has enough support from other, friends, family, etc. and I  only have a  couple of new friends in this country.\n\nLast   but not least, she already planned the entire life together with me.   she always mentions that I’m the best partner she ever had that I’m   kind, we can have long and deep conversations, I’m supportive and easy   going, etc. She had bad experiences with previous relationships and I   feel guilty just thinking about how broken she could be if I break up   with her but I got to a point that there are moments that a simple   comment/action coming from her annoys incredibly.\n\nThe   last days we haven’t shared too much time together because of work   going to the office, and I’m really happy to be alone in the flat. I   feel the freedom back.\n\nI truly   don’t know what to do, I somehow feel responsible for her emotions, and I   know it’s not okay. But i think I’ve developed a certain level of   emotional dependency with her, i refrain from doing activities that i   like to not hurt her feelings. I think this post is a bit venting a bit   looking for new perspectives.\n\nAny advice? Comments?  I'd like your opinions Thanks for reading,  sorry for any grammar mistake.\n\nTLDR: I think I’m in a toxic relationship with some flavors of emotional dependency and idk what to do",

You act like she’s on vacation and could do just fine without her around so much. She retaliates by pointing out the problems that arise if she stops taking responsibility for fixing them.\n\nMaybe you’re right. Maybe it is time for you to take on more responsibilities. But you’ve gone about addressing that all wrong. Instead of acknowledging the effort she’s been putting in, you’ve dismissed it. Instead of having an open conversation about whether you’re BOTH ready for this dynamic to change, and what that will look like, you’ve tried to unilaterally decide.

I'm devastated and I have never posted anything on reddit.\n\nMy bf and I have been dating for almost a year, we met through a dating app and it was a long distance relationship. We are Persians (in case it matters). Almost 3 months into our relationship, I found out that he was cheating on me with a Mexican girl. I forgave him as he told me that she was from a different country and would never marry her and he swore that he left her. In turns out he told her that he left me (so basically continued using her for sex). We both believed this liar! He continued sleeping with her and eventually he run away from her. She called me and told me that they were still together and were sleeping for another 2 months. After giving him a second chance, he moved in with me for a month. We lived together happily ever after, despite always having doubts that he was talking to others.\n\nHe moves to a different state for a job, Ohio and his ex gf calls him and cries because he left her and run away from her. He keeps talking to her behind my back and buys her a ticket to come visit him. I find out about it and he tells the ex gf not to come and blocks her. She still desperately shows up and stays with him for a week- despite, me calling his friend and all 4 of us having a big fight and me telling him to kick her out and he claimed it was 2 AM and he was gonna sleep on the couch and would kick her out the following day. I got super angry and changed my phone number. He was GONE for a week as she refused to leave his place and wanted to leave on her original flight day. Once she left, he kept emailing me and I forgave him again!\n\nI forgave him like a fool, a month later we find out the ex gf is pregnant (she removed her IUD and didn't tell him). I found out and I still stayed with him because I loved him to death and he was never going to be with her as she has 2 older children from different men and he refused to be involved in this child's or her life. She decided to keep the baby.\n\nWe have been having fights for the last 4-5 months because I remind him on daily basis that he cheated on me and remind him of her..... The reason I'm reaching out is because I need some support and few encouraging words..... WHAT WOULD YOU DO?\n\nPS: I'm 25+ and attractive with plenty of men wanting me, also I'm graduating from top medical school with an MD.\n\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH!",

Just because she can’t afford therapy doesn’t mean you should do the job because you can’t. The reason to go to therapy is because therapists are professionals who have years of training to understand human problems and fix them. A psychologist with a Ph.D. goes to school for 10 years to get that degree. Even a social worker needs a Masters Degrees. You are only 22. You have no idea what to do. Fortunately you are leaving so you can remove yourself from the situation. Don’t let her call you at all hours when you are gone. You have only been together a few months so she will probably find another guy to try to dump on. Try to encourage her to find a low cost clinic to get help. There are free social programs she can use. If she starts crying because you mention them, just walk away. There is nothing you can do if she does nothing."

Her response seems very disconnected to you. Did you guys get into a fight or something? Is this her way of being passive aggressive? It’s just kind of hard to believe that any girl who is in a serious relationship would do this. If this isn’t her being passive aggressive, and this is really her, I would suggest having a very direct conversation about it with her, and if she seems clueless or labels you, as either controlling or insecure, or whatever, just end the relationship because she’s clearly not in it 100%"

    "prompt": "I (24F) just found out my coworkers wrongly think I enabled an affair between my sister (21F) and a coworker(22M) behind his ex’s back and have been blackballing me because of it. What do I do? Tl;dr: my sister started dating my coworker shortly after my coworker’s breakup with another coworker, even though I explicitly was against them getting together so soon. No one told me everyone thought poorly of me, it’s been a year. What do I do?\n\n\nI work in tech retail, and have around 90 coworkers. We are very tight knit, and got along very well. I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it.

    "prompt": "I (24F) just found out my coworkers wrongly think I enabled an affair between my sister (21F) and a coworker(22M) behind his ex’s back and have been blackballing me because of it. What do I do? Tl;dr: my sister started dating my coworker shortly after my coworker’s breakup with another coworker, even though I explicitly was against them getting together so soon. No one told me everyone thought poorly of me, it’s been a year. What do I do?\n\n\nI work in tech retail, and have around 90 coworkers. We are very tight knit, and got along very well. I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it.

X said if I want to break up with him over this, I should just go ahead, but if I shouldn't bring up the whole cheating thing as he would suspect she told me, and it would hurt their friendship and that I owe her this much. She actually made me promise before telling me this and told me since she has done me a favour, I shouldn't throw her under the bus.\n\nShe clearly doesn't want to tank their friendship which I understand, but I can't just end a five year long relationship over something that might be a misunderstanding, and I can't know for sure if I don't talk to my BF about it.\n\nI am in disbelief that he would cheat on me, as that would be extremely out of character for him. Also, it doesn't make sense as we are in a healthy and loving relationship. I ended up confronting him about this by telling him some random number texted me this, and he denied everything and said that someone might be just messing with me.

    "completion": "Unfortunately some people feel that being soft spoken means you are an easy target and they like to feel superior, it can also be a sign of insecurity in that being soft spoken you don't feel the need for big gestures and such and still people are friends with you, it annoys them for you to be able to be included without all the things that they put effort into.\n\nIt is bullying honestly, subtle maybe but still bullying.\n\nWhat you choose to do about it depends on you, you can work a bit more on forming friendships in the group, ignore her attempts to not include you or decide that you don't care anyway. At some point if you show no signs of her bothering you then she might give up or she might make it more obvious. You could kill her with kindness and make sure she is always included when you do things, never say anything bad about her or say anything about anyone. \n\nIt hurts when people behave this way, but it is their problem, their insecurity that drives this. It isn't personal it is a lack of self awareness that drives a need to be popular. You don't have that drive so it clashes, people even take such behaviour as an attack on themselves for being different than them. Strange but true."

    "completion": "First off, sorry to hear about your mother. The loss of a parent is one of the hardest things a person can go through. This is the person that gave you life. Your reaction to your GF is VERY understandable. You both are at the point where you’re in a serious relationship. Life only gets harder and you will experience more loss. Unfortunately that’s how life works the older we get. If your partner is oblivious to your feelings it’s going to create even more issues down the road. It may also lead to a lot of resentment on your part. Think about if she lost a parent? Would she react the same way how she did about your mom’s passing? Or would her loss be more important than yours? If that’s the case, will you feel resentment towards her? If marriage and children is some thing you hope for in the future there are so many other things that may happen throughout your life and you’re going to need your partner to be there as your teammate and to support you through it. In my opinion, a relationship is nothing if there is not trust, support, and loyalty."

She actually made me promise before telling me this and told me since she has done me a favour, I shouldn't throw her under the bus.\n\nShe clearly doesn't want to tank their friendship which I understand, but I can't just end a five year long relationship over something that might be a misunderstanding, and I can't know for sure if I don't talk to my BF about it.\n\nI am in disbelief that he would cheat on me, as that would be extremely out of character for him. Also, it doesn't make sense as we are in a healthy and loving relationship. I ended up confronting him about this by telling him some random number texted me this, and he denied everything and said that someone might be just messing with me. In the time I have know X, I know she is trustworthy and a very collected person so I can't really think of why she would lie. Myabe she is just playing a stupid prank or something on me.\n\nAt this point, I don't have any proof other than her word, so I am at a loss. I trust my BF, but now there is this doubt in my head that maybe he might have cheated. I don't want to tell him X told me, but I got nothing else. \n\nAdvice?",
    "completion": "This seems very suspicious I think she is not telling the truth. To many factors here. Number one you should tell your boyfriend who said it because that may give you what you need. He may let you know she has always been in love with him."

    "completion": "A somewhat contrarian opinion, but it's worked for me, and I'm old and have had many relationships of all kinds: from romantic, to friendships, to those defying definitions.\n\nAnd here's my advice: there's nothing wrong with putting your heart and telling people how you feel. This applies both to your situation and any situations where you are the first to confess feelings, etc.  Anywhere where others would tell you to be indifferent and short.\n\nWill this approach of saying how you genuinely feel work?  Ah, I don't know. That also depends on your definition of what works. Sometimes it will lead to satisfying deep relationships where a terse note wouldn't, but other times it would not. So it's not a magic \"I'm going to make him like me\" approach, but there's nothing like that anyway.\n\nThe point is that these notes are often for yourself, rather than for him. For you to know that you've exposed how you feel, that you've made things clear and now he can figure out of he wants a relationship or not. And that itself can make you feel better and can help you get out of ruminating about him (perhaps).\n\nIn any case, they are unlikely to hurt. Could he still ignore you and not respond? Of course. But that's the situation now anyways.  So it's no worse, but you needn't feel like there's some \"right\" way of responding that you don't know due to your inexperience. \n\nNow as to \"putting you on back burner\" -- that's the part I really don't get. What's the harm? Suppose he does that to you -- and then what?  It's one of those phrases that sounds like it's a bad thing, but when you think of it, there's nothing really bad to it. As long as you don't change _your_ behavior.  Meaning: continue chatting with other guys, going out on dates if you get any, continue moving on and living your life. Will he come back to bring you back from that \"back burner\"?  Who knows. But it doesn't matter, as long as you are not sitting around and waiting for him.  If he does come back, you can reevaluate then.\n\nSorry for this beast of a comment. There's nothing wrong with the text you did write. But just... Don't be afraid to be yourself. Just because lots of other people buy in to \"standard advice\", doesn't mean that they have some secret knowledge. And showing interest in other people very rarely hurts. Typically it helps, and helps a lot. Again, as long as you are not sitting around changing your life for one guy or bombarding him with love notes all the time. But expressing how you feel once? Why not. Let him be the one worrying about how to respond, while you breathe easier for having put your feelings in words."

Like how he shouldn't know how I'm feeling, don't mention anything that I've done because if he cared then he would of asked these past couple of days. Also saying that if I put any hit that I'm still interested in him, then he might use that to put me in his back pocket, cause we don't actually know if he's dating/talking to other people. And they did a really good job of explaining/justify their reasoning on why I shouldn't send what I wrote. So i honestly chopped the majority of what I wrote and just send a text, saying that he's fine with being busy, thanks for letting me know, and how i wouldn't staying friends with him. He has yet to reply.\n\nI honestly feel like i react with my heart than my head the majority of the times when it comes to romantic relationship. So I honeslty don't know what to do? Cause I'm still interested in him but i don't want to keep waiting and then have some hope for something that might or might not happen. I've been trying to keep myself busy with school and trying to find a job in my degree. I've also being trying to train for a half marathon and might volunteer for a maid cafe that's coming to convention! I've also been talking to a guy (guy 2)  here and there that's in my school, but i just feel guilty cause what if something does happen with guy 2 and i just feel guilty and hoping something happens with the other guy? \n\nSorry for the long post and thanks :)",

But recently the guy in question has messaged me out of the blue (and on my phone number not Snapchat) and apologized how he's been busy with work and school. He also was saying how he hates how he doesn't have time for people he actually wants to spend it with and that he doesn't want to date me right now, cause he doesn't want to hurt me by being too busy to hang out with me or texting back. It was honestly a surprise to me cause we've barley mentioned dating but only having something casual while trying to get to know each other. Then at then end, he says that he would love to be friends right now. \n\nSo if you read the previous post, you know that i really have no relationship experience whatsoever and I also have friends/family who have dated before, so they really don't understand my experience of barley getting hit on or asked out and never having a boyfriend.

    "prompt": "I’m (35f) Second guessing ending a five year relationship with partner (37m) I never thought it would end. I could have never imagined myself without him. The first two years were a fairy tale. I grew so much with him and I thought we could continue to grow together. But...\n\nTwo years in, he took six months off to find himself/re-evaluate his non-career. He said he had a good amount of money saved but I paid the rent, thinking he was spending this time wisely. He started going to job interviews in sweatpants and never changed job types. I had to push him to get going and this built resentment that he was taking advantage of my kindness. \n\nI planned a European vacation for us, paid for it, and asked him to just plan one day for us. At the airport, on our way to our destination, he revealed to me that he was in massive debt and didn’t know what to do. He was mopey and angry our whole vacation. Didn’t want to go to dinner on my birthday or do anything touristy because it cost money. I tried to make the best of it because I was looking forward to it and put so much energy planning this vacation. He never planned the day I asked for and got mad at me that I was mad about it. \n\nOver the years, I explained I felt I had too much on my shoulders. He was always job hopping, using all his time off when he didn’t need it, and not having it when he really needed it, and having to either get fired or quit.  This never changed. He would go a couple months or longer between jobs to the point I would have to nag him and ask what was going on. He would get angry and say as long as he pays his half, why do I care??  I didn’t feel secure. I would never do that to him because I feel it puts more pressure on your partner.\n\nFast forward to the thing that was the last straw for me.

    "prompt": "I (M25) am struggling to identify whether the issue with my girlfriend (F25) is my own insecurity/clingyness or her behaviour. I (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for around 4 months. We met on a dating app, and after 2 months we decided to be official. As in, I asked her to be my girlfriend, she agreed. I don’t have much experience relationship wise, which fuels my belief that I could be acting clingy, but I do think it’s more than that.\n\nThroughout the relationship, in my opinion, every moment we’ve spent together in person has been great. We’ve talked about personal things like family, been intimate regularly, and at times it seems she doesn’t want the evening to end. So all good right… \n\n(Before I explain the next part, I should say to her credit she’s got a busy schedule, with work and other similar clubs and activities. All which are genuine reasons to be tied up during the day and weekends, and I wouldn’t expect her to ever stop doing something or change because of me. Nor do I expect us to be constantly in contact 24/7 or even every day. \n\nHowever, these are my concerns when apart: \n\n- Its always difficult to see her, and when we do hang out, it’s always limited time wise. We never spend an entire day together, and never the night. We only see each other roughly once every week/ week and a bit. This affects me, but alone isn’t the problem, I recognise her commitments. \n\n\n- The main issue lies in the seeming lack of effort. Every message takes hours for a response, so it’s difficult to discuss anything - (yes we could call but see next paragraph). Attempts to make plans when busy on her part, are rarely met with attempts to rearrange on particular days. 90% of plans derive from me.\n\n\n- I try calling occasionally just to talk or plan something,  but she almost never picks up - again could just be busy which I accept. However, missed calls only receive an apology text hours later. I never receive a call back. In fact, I don’t think she’s ever randomly called in four months just to talk to me- which I’ll admit is a bit upsetting. When she was away for a week with work, I thought I’d give her one call in the evening near the end of the trip to see how things were goings- I got 10mins of her time.\n\n- an example which actually affected me: Recently I had to travel back home for a sad event which she knew. Later that day I tried texting her as I simply wished to hear from her; it took two days to send a couple of messages back and forth due to not replying for several hours each time. Followed by a final ‘are you free tonight to call’, which received no response for 24 hours. Again, that being an apology text and no actual call. The reason for this being family visiting. A partially valid excuse, but in my head, if my partner ever texted asking to call after seeming upset or having been through something, I would not hesitate to give them my time, even just for half an hour. Would you not always do that for someone important?\n\n- for all points above, they feel even worse when combined with how she organises her time with others. I don’t expect to be a number one priority or to demand attention; but when someone regularly makes plans with friends and calls them in the evenings along with family etc, but then never calls their boyfriend once in four months….\n\n\nI appreciate anyone who made it through, I know it’s long. I know I’ll have to have a conversation with her but could do with some genuine honest advice before proceeding - whether it be to address my own issues or hers.",

This affects me, but alone isn’t the problem, I recognise her commitments. \n\n\n- The main issue lies in the seeming lack of effort. Every message takes hours for a response, so it’s difficult to discuss anything - (yes we could call but see next paragraph). Attempts to make plans when busy on her part, are rarely met with attempts to rearrange on particular days. 90% of plans derive from me.\n\n\n- I try calling occasionally just to talk or plan something,  but she almost never picks up - again could just be busy which I accept. However, missed calls only receive an apology text hours later. I never receive a call back. In fact, I don’t think she’s ever randomly called in four months just to talk to me- which I’ll admit is a bit upsetting.

Followed by a final ‘are you free tonight to call’, which received no response for 24 hours. Again, that being an apology text and no actual call. The reason for this being family visiting.

I (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for around 4 months. We met on a dating app, and after 2 months we decided to be official. As in, I asked her to be my girlfriend, she agreed. I don’t have much experience relationship wise, which fuels my belief that I could be acting clingy, but I do think it’s more than that.\n\nThroughout the relationship, in my opinion, every moment we’ve spent together in person has been great.

I moved out of state after college for work, and maintaining close familial relationships over the years has proved to be difficult, particularly with my sister, who is eternally “busy”. \n\nMy father (M86) passed away last July , and his will left everything in equal parts to me  and my sister, and named her as executor. My father was not anything close to wealthy, but he did have roughly $80k in savings, plus a fully paid-for house and a largish wooded property, each worth approximately $120k. \n\nShortly after the funeral, my sister and I talked and  agreed to split the savings, sell the house, and each of us will take one of the two vehicles  he owned. My sister was supposed to transfer the vehicles to our names, which involved filing a single piece of paper with the DMV within 120 days of my father’s death, but she “didn’t have time” to do it. This has turned what should have been a simple process into a bit of a nightmare, complicated even more by me living in another state. I am planning to fly down there in a few weeks to pick up the truck and drive it back. In the meantime I’ve been calling, texting and emailing her trying to figure out how we transfer the title. She ignores my texts and emails, and never returns my calls. To be fair, this isn’t entirely out of character for her, as even her 20-yr old daughter complains about not being able to get in touch with her. Still, a part of me is starting to wonder if my sister is trying to pull something unsavory here. \n\nBesides being my sister, as executor, she has a legal obligation to keep me informed with what’s going on with the estate. Which she seemingly has no interest in doing.  I’m not 100% sure how all this works,e.g. I don’t know if the will went to probate - based on the value of the estate it should have, but my sister didn’t respond to my questions about it - or if there’s any court involvement at all, or if there’s anything that I can do to help anyway. \n\nNow, do I think my sister is the type of person who would help herself to an outsized portion of my dad’s estate? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe? I do think that on some level my sister feels she “sacrificed” more for our parents, what with me moving far away right after college, and her staying in the same small town we grew up in. Not that either of my parents required any special care (either health wise or financially) in their later years. My sister has mentioned that in her opinion I have “lots of money” and “she’s the one with two kids in college”. \n\nI don’t know, I guess I’m just wondering why she’s avoiding me so much. A little communication would go a lot way. Am I making something out of nothing here?",

If you think of yourself as less than her, she’ll eventually feel that way too. If you’re working part time then you absolutely do the housework and cook most of the time. The person who works a lot more hours should not have to come home and do chores that you have time for. This isn’t your dad’s relationship. It’s yours and your girlfriends. Remember that.

    "completion": "Do not listen to anyone else about your relationship except for you and your partner (unless the relationship is abusive or unhealthy). All that matters here is your feelings and her feelings. The real question is, is she happy, and are you happy? If one of you isn’t happy in this relationship, I think it’s time to call it quits. However, if the both of you are perfectly happy together, there’s no need to prepare yourself for any heartbreak. That’s not what love and relationships are about; these things can be scary because you’re not supposed to prepare yourself for anything. You’re supposed to be open, vulnerable, and accept the fact that anything is possible. \n\nSo basically what I’m saying is, have a conversation with her about how she’s feeling, and look into how you’re feeling too.

    "prompt": "My(M52) sister (F55) is acting super sus regarding regarding the execution of my dad’s will \nMy sister and I have an ok relationship, but I wouldn’t call us close. I moved out of state after college for work, and maintaining close familial relationships over the years has proved to be difficult, particularly with my sister, who is eternally “busy”. \n\nMy father (M86) passed away last July , and his will left everything in equal parts to me  and my sister, and named her as executor. My father was not anything close to wealthy, but he did have roughly $80k in savings, plus a fully paid-for house and a largish wooded property, each worth approximately $120k. \n\nShortly after the funeral, my sister and I talked and  agreed to split the savings, sell the house, and each of us will take one of the two vehicles  he owned. My sister was supposed to transfer the vehicles to our names, which involved filing a single piece of paper with the DMV within 120 days of my father’s death, but she “didn’t have time” to do it. This has turned what should have been a simple process into a bit of a nightmare, complicated even more by me living in another state. I am planning to fly down there in a few weeks to pick up the truck and drive it back. In the meantime I’ve been calling, texting and emailing her trying to figure out how we transfer the title. She ignores my texts and emails, and never returns my calls. To be fair, this isn’t entirely out of character for her, as even her 20-yr old daughter complains about not being able to get in touch with her. Still, a part of me is starting to wonder if my sister is trying to pull something unsavory here. \n\nBesides being my sister, as executor, she has a legal obligation to keep me informed with what’s going on with the estate. Which she seemingly has no interest in doing.  I’m not 100% sure how all this works,e.g. I don’t know if the will went to probate - based on the value of the estate it should have, but my sister didn’t respond to my questions about it - or if there’s any court involvement at all, or if there’s anything that I can do to help anyway. \n\nNow, do I think my sister is the type of person who would help herself to an outsized portion of my dad’s estate? Honestly, I don’t know. Maybe? I do think that on some level my sister feels she “sacrificed” more for our parents, what with me moving far away right after college, and her staying in the same small town we grew up in. Not that either of my parents required any special care (either health wise or financially) in their later years. My sister has mentioned that in her opinion I have “lots of money” and “she’s the one with two kids in college”. \n\nI don’t know, I guess I’m just wondering why she’s avoiding me so much. A little communication would go a lot way. Am I making something out of nothing here?",

Think i gotta leave but don't want to(got a toddler) Hey  there just tryna get some opinions. Ive been with my SO for 10 yrs now  and for a while ive been very passive with her controlling behavior but  its worked out. shes always been opinionated, and spoke freely but has  always been aggressive and controlling with everything. Over the last  recent year or so its started to get to me and i often have flashbacks  of things shes done that have been red flags over the years and i resent  her for it alot. She notices but i feel so deep in it now i dont even  argue or talk about things anymore. i just shutdown and go on with my  day while she seethes on her own.\n\nA  little background: we moved cross country and have a toddler now. We've  been through alot together but now that i'm having realizations about  our past i notice most of the hard work or problems were put on me to  handle. Shes told me not to hang out with people because they treat me  like a door mat. Talks about how my family is always talking down to me  and blames everything and everyone else for our problems. I've been  shown warning signs and people have also told me about these things in  the past and i chose to stay.\n\nRecently  weve been having alot of fights because I tell her that shes not  pulling her weight. She hasnt worked in a few years, she doesnt drive,  barely cleans, doesnt do her own laundry, hasnt contributed to bills for  years and wants to travel all the time. she does find things on market  place that are nice but i always mention if she worked we would have  more $ in the bank. I dont want to keep bad mouthing as im hoping for a  unbiased opinion though i think i havent done well in creating that.\n\nanyway i can keep going on more but want to get to the point.\n\nNow  we just had a argument because she wants to travel for some free stay  IHG timeshare. (Ironically when she was getting hooked by the sales  person about 2 year ago i insisted on not taking the deal because it  wasnt financially feasible with a baby on the way. she did it anyway and  ofcourse that was a fight). anyway fast forward the time has come up to  book this trip or we will lose out on $200.\n\nWe  literally just took a trip 2 weeks ago that cost me a little over $1000  considering travel expenses and all that. Traveling is so annoying with  her. She is a late packer and late waker upper, always needs things and  over packs and always forgets things too. I known this from previous  travels and i always get anxious cause of these things because they  always happen without falter. Now with a kid its more annoying. She  always gets angry cause im upset when we travel and says i get angry and  anxious. I tell her everyone does but she makes me very anxious due to  these things.\n\nSometimes i wish i  can travel without her honestly. anyway since i foot the bill everything  falls on me, mind you i dont have a great job, just enough to get us by  and have a little extra. she doesnt drive either so im chauffeur  everytime and because of her tardiness im babysitting most mornings.  Also we have dogs! guess who takes the dogs out and feeds them every  day.\n\nAnyway, point is I dont want  to go. I made it clear it was going to cost too much with the flight,  car rental, food and whatever else we choose to do. Also the pet care we  would need because of flying out. The stress of thinking of all this  has automatically put me in a NO especially cause again im paying, im  driving. she wanted to sit down and talk about how much it would cost  and making a plan but i told her I dont like travelling with her and I  didnt want to spend over a grand again on a trip when we just took one. I  would love to go but the truth is the idea of traveling with her is a  nightmare especially after this last time, i told myself i wouldnt do it  again.\n\nI dont know what to do or  say now. She is mad at me and told me were going to lose our 200 but i  really dont care, its worth it to me. shes very upset and isnt talking  but im so used to it im not bothered. I think im at my end of the rope  with this and its heartbreaking but im just zombie mode because i love  my kid. Ill live miserable as long as i can raise my child but i dont  think thats healthy.\n\nTLDR: Wife  wants to travel or well lose money. Just took trip that cost over a  grand and this one will too even though its months away. Travelling with  her drives me crazy and makes me anxious i dont enjopy travel at all. I  foot the bills, I drive, I physically make things happen while shutting  up. Shes controlling and like to use it to guilt trip me but ive had  enough and now she doesnt want to speak and we resent eachother.\n\nhave a kid and will stay miserable as long as im here for my child.\n\nI  dont know how to leave or talk about these things. I feel theres no  fixing at this point so im just  begrudgingly moving through life for my  child.\n\nI dont know how to tell  her i dont want to do this trip either as i know she is going to keep  bringing it up and getting mad at me.\n\nany advice on any of this is welcome.

Shes told me not to hang out with people because they treat me  like a door mat. Talks about how my family is always talking down to me  and blames everything and everyone else for our problems. I've been  shown warning signs and people have also told me about these things in  the past and i chose to stay.\n\nRecently  weve been having alot of fights because I tell her that shes not  pulling her weight.

(she doesn't feel like I do)\n\nA bit of backstory into me, I was an undiagnosed ADHDer living and struggling with life throughout my life until meeting her. She made me see that there is something not right with me and so 2 year's ago I decided to go seek help and understand myself more about why I am a colossal f*ck up that can't hold a job down, fails with finances, fails with an intimacy beyond the initial stage, fails at showing up on time and various other issues.\n\nA year later I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, plus for me, I can start to understand myself more and put the right stuff in place to help me manage a bearable life. That was December. 3 weeks ago I started medication however I'm not seeing any benefit yet. \n\nI and I didn't have the best of starts in a relationship, I was a tremendous dick and wasn't considerate at all.\n\nI struggle with long stained periods with someone, anyone I'm not I'm notalkitalkinga relationship with. I stop talking, I'm in the present person and struggle with starting conversations about anything that's not happening right now or wasn't that long ago and even that is a struggle remembering stuff to talk about. The conversation doesn't even start because it's one-sided.\n\nEven when she doesn't talk to me I struggle to remember the details and previous conversations which makes it seem like I don't give a shit but I do, I do. That I now know it's because of ADHD but she says that I am now just using that as an excuse for everything. I'm not, that wasn't the goal, the goal was to understand why I am the way I am and to get help on coping methods to make this all somewhat better. But she should understand this as her son is a dud and autistic, I'm pretty sure I am autistic too but that's a different path to get a diagnosis as an adult something I have tried to get a referral for but doc refused first time waiting on a report from the adhd. Need to follow up on that.\n\nWe rarely share the same bed, her daughter who is 9 sleeps with her (stepdad) we would have thought she would be out by now. (she had cancer at the age of 5 I know things changed psychology before my wife and her during that time)\n\nBut that's the time when I open up more and become more intimate. We had great sex at the beginning. It's not about that though I just want her back.\n\nShe has a fair deal of issues, she has an extensive list of meds she takes for various conditions. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit I let her advance in her career she wanted to become a counselor, so she took the training and got promoted in her current workplace and now works with children as a counselor around our school district. I as result became more of a house husband, that is trying to break through in the online space and work from home to be here for her kids as a much as possible. I fail at that too but I can understand why now, I made some decent money during 2020 online but the business partner then had a life breakdown of his own and started scamming people behind my back using the brand, that business obviously came crashing down fast and I've struggled mentally and physically to get past that and procrastinated a lot because of that. \n\nShe ended up needing to take a second job to bring in some more cash, 3 days a week in an evening as a texted based counselor online from home 3hrs a night. \n\nI took up driving for takeaways to bring in some cash whilst I build up the business that still isn't producing cash. That job means I'm out of the house 5-6 nights a week for 6-7 hours. Meaning I get home around 12 - 1am need to get to sleep and be up for 7-7.30 to sort the kids out. I pretty much leave when she gets home they might be an hour or two before I go. \n\nI struggle with the general house work as every adhder does, the house needs decorating and fixing up, she's been on my case about that for year's, I've slowly started now though. It's slow because that takes up so much of my mental cappicatiy. The house isn't the best at times, a bit messy when I've proitised other things and stuff. I need a \"lazy day\" at times, where I'm pretty much dead and I get the bear min done, a quick vac, pots and cat litter tray cleaned along with getting the kids to school and back.\n\nThat winds her up like nothing else but to me it's needed.\n\nI used to not be able to control my anger when we'd get into arguments but I never hit her or anything like that. Just shout and slam doors but that's controlled now I haven't done that in a while maybe the odd flair up but nothing major.\n\nIt's done more of a 180 she swears and gets angry at me more now than the other way round.\n\nHer daughter is really stubborn, and I struggle at times to get her to do what is needed, my wife struggles with this too. I don't raise my voice at her because she just shuts down completely and I get your not my dad. Which is fair enough but it has meant she's been late to school and not attended at times where we are now on school attendance monitoring. It's getting better with that in place. I don't want her to suffer and I don't want my wife to get the stick for it when its her that has to go to work and pay the bills for which I'm enterally grateful for.\n\nWe had a report to social services from school because one of the daughters friends that used to come round to the house made an accusation, that my wife has been sending inappropriate images to another man and receiving them and she has seen them.\n\nObviously my wife denies this and I have no question of whether that's the truth or not that happened last Wednesday, when the said kid was supposed to be coming to ours after school but decided to run off from school before pick up time. My wife had previously said she's not allowed at our house anymore but she's said stuff like that before and has never meant it. I thought the daughter had arranged this with her mum but as it turns out not. We didn't really see each other between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. I was working everyone was asleep when I returned.\n\nI didn't even know myself until we got to school when the daughter told me about her coming. So I just went with it because she would have refused to move if I said anything otherwise. Stubborn. \n\nThis is all my fault apparently but before that Tuesday my wife came home visibly upset and fed up with everything, she spent 30 mins in the car before even stepping inside the house clearly had been crying. I tried asking her about it, I got \"I'm fine\" over and over again I had to leave for work.\n\nSince the she's avoided me and her daughter pretty as much as possible.\n\nWednesday night she locked herself in with her son and slept with him instead. Thursday she went to her friends house and came home only when I needed to leave. And Friday we had opticians for the whole family, it was hard, the daughter kicked off 3 times, 2 of the times I was the one to calm her down. After we dropped her off at her days where she was crying as she went in the house not talking or saying bye to her mum. \n\nWe got home and I had an usual Friday off, I really wanted to try repair this but she had other plans and got dressed up and went out to another friend's house and took alchol with her and didn't return home after 2am. I'm not sure how much she had to drink but she drove home and with her meds its really unpredictable how it affects her sometimes she's drunk after only a few. I was asleep. Her daughter came home at around 9pm confused to why her mother wasn't here to which I had to play with her and be with her until she was asleep. I didn't mind but it was hard when this is all going on.\n\nNow she's in her sons room again today, but I think she's asleep and struggling with her chronic fatigue.\n\nThat's not all of it, but you get a picture.\n\nI love this girl, I find her incredibly hot, I miss the intimacy and I just want her to be happier most of all. \n\nI see it all falling apart and I have no one to talk too about it.\n\nI ditched my friends because they wasn't being supportive and I would have stayed being that dick I was at the start. \n\nI've distanced myself away from my family because of other issues.\n\nAnd my wife thinks I'm just like her exes, out to make her life miserable and cause problems in her life.\n\nWhen it's the opposite I do all I can to change and better myself.

The conversation doesn't even start because it's one-sided.\n\nEven when she doesn't talk to me I struggle to remember the details and previous conversations which makes it seem like I don't give a shit but I do, I do. That I now know it's because of ADHD but she says that I am now just using that as an excuse for everything. I'm not, that wasn't the goal, the goal was to understand why I am the way I am and to get help on coping methods to make this all somewhat better. But she should understand this as her son is a dud and autistic, I'm pretty sure I am autistic too but that's a different path to get a diagnosis as an adult something I have tried to get a referral for but doc refused first time waiting on a report from the adhd. Need to follow up on that.\n\nWe rarely share the same bed, her daughter who is 9 sleeps with her (stepdad) we would have thought she would be out by now. (she had cancer at the age of 5 I know things changed psychology before my wife and her during that time)\n\nBut that's the time when I open up more and become more intimate. We had great sex at the beginning. It's not about that though I just want her back.\n\nShe has a fair deal of issues, she has an extensive list of meds she takes for various conditions. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit I let her advance in her career she wanted to become a counselor, so she took the training and got promoted in her current workplace and now works with children as a counselor around our school district. I as result became more of a house husband, that is trying to break through in the online space and work from home to be here for her kids as a much as possible. I fail at that too but I can understand why now, I made some decent money during 2020 online but the business partner then had a life breakdown of his own and started scamming people behind my back using the brand, that business obviously came crashing down fast and I've struggled mentally and physically to get past that and procrastinated a lot because of that. \n\nShe ended up needing to take a second job to bring in some more cash, 3 days a week in an evening as a texted based counselor online from home 3hrs a night. \n\nI took up driving for takeaways to bring in some cash whilst I build up the business that still isn't producing cash. That job means I'm out of the house 5-6 nights a week for 6-7 hours. Meaning I get home around 12 - 1am need to get to sleep and be up for 7-7.30 to sort the kids out. I pretty much leave when she gets home they might be an hour or two before I go. \n\nI struggle with the general house work as every adhder does, the house needs decorating and fixing up, she's been on my case about that for year's, I've slowly started now though. It's slow because that takes up so much of my mental cappicatiy. The house isn't the best at times, a bit messy when I've proitised other things and stuff. I need a \"lazy day\" at times, where I'm pretty much dead and I get the bear min done, a quick vac, pots and cat litter tray cleaned along with getting the kids to school and back.\n\nThat winds her up like nothing else but to me it's needed.\n\nI used to not be able to control my anger when we'd get into arguments but I never hit her or anything like that. Just shout and slam doors but that's controlled now I haven't done that in a while maybe the odd flair up but nothing major.\n\nIt's done more of a 180 she swears and gets angry at me more now than the other way round.\n\nHer daughter is really stubborn, and I struggle at times to get her to do what is needed, my wife struggles with this too. I don't raise my voice at her because she just shuts down completely and I get your not my dad. Which is fair enough but it has meant she's been late to school and not attended at times where we are now on school attendance monitoring. It's getting better with that in place. I don't want her to suffer and I don't want my wife to get the stick for it when its her that has to go to work and pay the bills for which I'm enterally grateful for.\n\nWe had a report to social services from school because one of the daughters friends that used to come round to the house made an accusation, that my wife has been sending inappropriate images to another man and receiving them and she has seen them.\n\nObviously my wife denies this and I have no question of whether that's the truth or not that happened last Wednesday, when the said kid was supposed to be coming to ours after school but decided to run off from school before pick up time. My wife had previously said she's not allowed at our house anymore but she's said stuff like that before and has never meant it. I thought the daughter had arranged this with her mum but as it turns out not. We didn't really see each other between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. I was working everyone was asleep when I returned.\n\nI didn't even know myself until we got to school when the daughter told me about her coming. So I just went with it because she would have refused to move if I said anything otherwise. Stubborn. \n\nThis is all my fault apparently but before that Tuesday my wife came home visibly upset and fed up with everything, she spent 30 mins in the car before even stepping inside the house clearly had been crying. I tried asking her about it, I got \"I'm fine\" over and over again I had to leave for work.\n\nSince the she's avoided me and her daughter pretty as much as possible.\n\nWednesday night she locked herself in with her son and slept with him instead. Thursday she went to her friends house and came home only when I needed to leave. And Friday we had opticians for the whole family, it was hard, the daughter kicked off 3 times, 2 of the times I was the one to calm her down. After we dropped her off at her days where she was crying as she went in the house not talking or saying bye to her mum. \n\nWe got home and I had an usual Friday off, I really wanted to try repair this but she had other plans and got dressed up and went out to another friend's house and took alchol with her and didn't return home after 2am. I'm not sure how much she had to drink but she drove home and with her meds its really unpredictable how it affects her sometimes she's drunk after only a few. I was asleep. Her daughter came home at around 9pm confused to why her mother wasn't here to which I had to play with her and be with her until she was asleep. I didn't mind but it was hard when this is all going on.\n\nNow she's in her sons room again today, but I think she's asleep and struggling with her chronic fatigue.\n\nThat's not all of it, but you get a picture.\n\nI love this girl, I find her incredibly hot, I miss the intimacy and I just want her to be happier most of all. \n\nI see it all falling apart and I have no one to talk too about it.\n\nI ditched my friends because they wasn't being supportive and I would have stayed being that dick I was at the start. \n\nI've distanced myself away from my family because of other issues.\n\nAnd my wife thinks I'm just like her exes, out to make her life miserable and cause problems in her life.\n\nWhen it's the opposite I do all I can to change and better myself. But I have my struggles and limitations. \n\nI needed to write out.",
    "completion": "You both should be in therapy if you're not already. Individual for now at least. You're both dealing with so much right now. Medication can take a time to fully work.\n\nI'm not understanding why social services got involved in an accusation of an affair between two adults, let alone two adults she's not related to. Who is the man and how would she have seen the \"texts\"?"

You both need more sleep and more social support.

Use that as your stable base and do food delivery when you have the energy. Take a step back from your business for now\n- have a proper sit-down conversation with her about building in more rest. You need an occasional lazy day and probably so does she.  What can you change in your weekly schedule that gives you both a bit more time to decompress and sleep?\n- find an online /whatsapp support group for the adhd. You need to talk to other people who understand it.\n- make sure you still tell her you love her and give her hugs and kisses every day, every when you're frustrated\n\nI also have inattentive adhd. It's hard to go through life feeling like every single thing you do is wrong and out of control, and everyone around you hates you for it. \nWhich medication are you on?

    "prompt": "My[22M] Gf[21f] was sexually assaulted/raped and the guilt is taking a toll on both of us I know, this is my third post, and I wish I didn’t have to, but I can’t talk to anyone else about it, as that would be a massive breach of trust. It seems so surreal that one person has experienced so much trauma, but it’s too late now, so we just have to deal with the aftermath. That is what is difficult for both of us though, and that’s why I seek advice. Mainly for her.\n\nAbout the situation, basically what happened then.\nWhen my girlfriend was younger, and before she met me, she met some guy over the internet. (Note, this is a different person than the one from my first post)\nAlready starts off bad, but okay.\nThey didn’t meet on a dating platform and it was just a friendship.\n\nAfter a while, I don’t know how long, days, weeks, months maybe, he started to get touchy. My gf was in an abusive relationship as well, previously, I don’t know the exact time, so speaking up already was incredibly difficult, if possible at all.\n\nWhen the situation escalated, and in my opinion turned from sexual assault, as if that wasn’t bad enough, into rape, obviously everything got worse.\nI don’t know how often it was, if even more than once.\n\nThat’s enough tho, because now she is blaming herself for not doing anything about it. She says she didn’t want it to happen, but back then never said anything, even silently agreed to (I would stop reading here, cuz it definitely made me throw up. And no, not because of her, but the situation) the perpetrator to finish, well you can guess where.\n\n\nThat was pretty much the whole f*cked up situation.\nNeedless to say, a pregnancy scare followed afterwards, the worst anxiety she says she ever felt.\n\nAnd even now, years later, it is still weighing on her mind. She’s been spiraling downwards lately, also stepping slowly into SH (Self Harm) territory, and been unable to focus, on anything really.\n\nThis post isn’t about me though, so I’m asking for advice for her.\n\nShe feels guilt because she feels like she let it happen.\nI tried to tell her already that it wasn’t.\nMentioning sexual coercion, the trauma responses, mainly Fawn, and that the situation made it impossible to decide freely.\n\nShe still wants to hurt herself and is disgusted by everything she’s doing and did.\n\nAnd nothing I say seems to help with her guilt, so do you have any advice?\nMainly on how I could help her deal with the guilt and the memory of that event.\n\nIf you have any advice for me as well, I’d appreciate it, but it isn’t necessary.\nLike I said, I’m asking for my girlfriend\n\nMy struggle is only panic attacks, when thinking back about how she must’ve felt, and how powerless to that memory both of us are.\n\nBut I feel like getting better since I realized that the situation was pretty f*ed up to begin with and she’s not at fault.\nBut how do I show her?",

We got it at a lower interest rate 3.25% while they give 5% interest now, the house needs some fixing and I have a lot of debt that will be paid off by 2024 after 2024 I can probably afford to get my roof fixed, I don't want to keep it because of all the memories but I kind of want to have something for my daughter for her future. I know this is long but I'm hurt and desperate and I can't think straight, I feel like I failed my daughter, I came from a broken family and swore I will do everything to keep mine together, turns out I failed.

    "prompt": "23 f 21 m I went through my bfs phone yesterday and saw that he was dming girls on instagram and asking them to go on dates while i was miscarrying. During my miscarriage his mom passed away and he was very distant from me. long story short i gave him space to grieve his mom but i still let him know i needed some type of support from him. he acted like his loss was much bigger than mine and that he couldn’t be there for me as well. i had a feeling that something was going on based off his behavior these past weeks and decided to go through his phone. of course we got into an argument where he yelled “fuck that baby” so i kicked him out. of course i’m upset we broke up and he was cheating on me during a time i really needed him, but for him to say that about my baby is shocking. now i feel like my baby only mattered to me and everything was fake",

    "prompt": "I(19F) am struggling with my first relationship with my boyfriend (20M) &amp; scared we might not be able to get over our problem. My boyfriend and I have had a great relationship together for over three months. I will admit we may have moved very fast into a relationship after knowing each other for about two weeks and saying \"I love you\" to each other the day we became official. It's crazy I know. We just spent those weeks getting to know each other so well and were both very open about communicating everything. Before we got together, my boyfriend expressed some hesitation, because he didn't think he would get into a relationship in college and really values his alone time. I didn't think much of the alone time part, because I like my alone time as well. But this has become our only issue in the relationship. We communicate well, have amazing intimacy, and love each other. I think with him having been in a relationship before I thought he would be more comfortable with initiating, spending time together, and other relationship things, so I had a base line expectation of for a relationship, but this is my first relationship so I was mainly guessing. I am usually the one initiating things, so when it's me mostly asking to hang out, then a lot of the time I have to tweak my initial proposal to what he's comfortable with. It mainly feels that we only do things on his time and what he's wants, because he wants to get work done, read, or just simply be alone. I expressed this to him and he was understanding of it and didn't realize that it came off that way. We mostly only spend alone time together towards later into the night. His preference is to come over past 7pm and leave around 12-2am, and we on average spend one day a week together hanging out. We have a class together, and he likes to say since we have class together twice a week then we are spending time together. I don't really view it that way, like it's nice to see him during that time, but we can't really talk during class. We talk after for about 10 minutes as I walk him towards his car during my two hour class break, but it's not what I consider spending time together, but maybe I view it wrong. We text almost everyday but there isn't really any consistent morning or night check-ins, and we don't really facetime or call often, unless I am the one doing it. He's really bad at responding, because he puts his phone on do not disturb a lot to stay off his phone. He also has ADHD, so he gets distracted often. And I just to be understanding that he does have ADHD, but it doesn't seem like he's trying to work on it to remember to text me back, and he reminds me that his house is chaotic with his roomates. He said that he has sacrificed a lot of his alone time, that I'm his number 1 person in his life, he talks to me more than his best friend who lives in his home state, and that he wouldn't have dated me if I wasn't special. He tells me this, but it doesn't make me feel any better, because if I was that important, why can't he give me more and what he knows I deserve. I think he's at the point where he's not willing to give me more. He says he reluctant to initiate, because I find it hard when he leaves or I have to leave, and I usually ask to him to stay a little longer. Then, he states we've spent this many hours together, we see each other in class, and we'll hang out sometime soon (which is whenever I initiate again). I am the type of person who thinks that tomorrow isn't guaranteed, so I don't find the last part as reassuring as he does. To him, it should feel enough. He dated me, thinking that I would be comfortable with this and this would be enough. I try to savor and prolong the time we spend together, because I feel like we don't get enough time together. But he sees me getting sad or disappointed, so he feels reluctant to ask to hang out to prevent me getting sad, but I get even more sad when I feel like I'm waiting for his attention. We've talked about our time issue many times, but we haven't been able to resolve it. But we are just now trying to really think about solutions. It's almost like a losing situation. I get more time. He's not happy because he can't have his alone time. He doesn't give me more time. I'm not happy feeling like I'm waiting around for his time and attention. I don't want to give up, but I have no idea how to solve this. Please I need some advice on whether I am asking too much, is this salvageable, or any tips on how to solve issues in a relationship.

I am really happy with our relationship, but we’ve recently hit a rough patch and I really don’t know who to turn to to ask about this. My boyfriend lives at home while he goes to school, like myself, and also works. He doesn’t pay rent because his parents haven’t asked he do it, but he does pay other bills for the household such as light and the phone bills. He doesn’t make much but he tries his best. His parents were always neglectful towards him growing up and treated him like a stranger - often forgetting he even existed and prioritizing his siblings. His room is not insulated so it’s always cold, no windows and they don’t even allow him to cook there or have their water; he has to get his own. I also live with my parents and I’ve tried to get him to stay a few nights here, but my parents say no because they don’t want to be involved in something. There’s not much I can really do besides send him some cash when I can; I feel horrible.\n\nTwo days ago, they kicked him out after he couldn’t afford to pay one of the bills that month. He’d spent a majority of his check on water and groceries. He’s been bunking with a friend and I still feel so horrible that I can’t take him in. He’s been talking to me about enlisting in the military because he didn’t really have any other options prior to being kicked out and I’ve always said I didn’t agree. He didn’t want to leave me, so he stayed. Now that this has happened, I think I should encourage him to do it. He doesn’t have a place to sleep or much money, and I can barely spot him a few dollars for a night somewhere as it is. If it means that we have to break up so he can do his career, I will be devastated but I can’t let him live like this anymore. However, he is my first love. I don’t know if I can let him go. What should I do?",

To me, this sounds like she could be, but feels forced to stay because of your extreme responses."
