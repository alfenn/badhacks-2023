[{"prompt":"I(22F) don't want my bf(21M) to watch porn I know this is a very unpopular opinion and I'm going to be called controlling, but I have to ask about this because my heart is breaking.\n\nFor some background, we have been together for six months, we don't live together but I spend most of the time at his place. I have a higher sex drive than his, to the point we'd have sex 10 times a day if it were up to me and I'm also adventurous in bed, I am up to try anything and I have never refused any wish of his. I have been called beautiful many times in my life, by boys, girls, teachers, cashiers, doctors, you name it. He told me mine are the biggest boobs he's seen naked(not that he is very experienced, but it was nice to hear) and that he likes my big butt. I've also had compliments before about my flat stomach and small waist. My hair is almost down to my tailbone and it's healthy and thick. I'm not saying these things to be arrogant, a lot of the time I dislike the way I look and I'd change a million things. My point is that by society's standards and also by his standards I'm good looking and it's not like he has any reason to be unsatisfied with the way I am sexually. So the question is, why am I not enough?\n\nI don't have a problem with masturbation, I get off too but without any material, in my mind I am watching a sex scene between two generic humans, fuzzy faces, nobody specific, just bodies and the two important organs. I wouldn't have a problem with erotica either, it's the explicit visual content that bothers me. I'm not asking him to adhere to a standard I don't hold myself to. He said that sex with me can be a chore which made me really upset, because rubbing one out to naked strangers is not a chore. I guess that would be because he wants to please me as I hive a higher sex drive. When I'm not around he masturbates two times a day, so I don't know why he doesn't find me good enough to want to have sex with as much or more. I've told him about my problem with porn and he called me crazy and controlling but I still think that in a couple sex should be about the two of them, not the two of them and thousands of naked women. In the past he said he would never want to have sex with another woman because he just wants one and one is enough, but apparently this is not true. Even on the days he knows I am coming he still masturbates before I get there.\n\nHe said it's something he can't not do, but what does that say about him in regards to sexual discipline? Also, he told me that all men watch porn, which I know is not true, and if they don't watch porn they're losers, which to me seems very simple-minded. He's generally a nice guy and I love him so I don't want to break up with him, I don't even think I could, but this thing is tearing me apart. Another thing that speaks to his attitude about this subject is that he used to comment pretty crass things on TikTok. He is a gym bro and commented \"I wish I was that platform\" on a video with a girl who peed herself doing deadlifts, \"mommy\" and \"don't ask me the color of anything\" and things like that. He said those were just jokes and eventually stopped commenting because \"he didn't want me to make a scene\", so not because he genuinely doesn't want to.\n\nI've come to hate myself and to hate that I'm not good enough for him. Please advise, what can I do to make him see things from my point of view?","completion":"This sounds very fake and like you are bragging about how hot and sexy you are to get dms."},{"prompt":"I(22F) don't want my bf(21M) to watch porn I know this is a very unpopular opinion and I'm going to be called controlling, but I have to ask about this because my heart is breaking.\n\nFor some background, we have been together for six months, we don't live together but I spend most of the time at his place.

He’s not the guy for you."},{"prompt":"I (22m) am having a relationship dilemma with gf (19m). Part of it is ranting and part of it is advice seeking, bear with me. I just want somebody to talk to about the matter.\n\nMy gf (19f) and I (22m) are currently on a break. She had ask for one since she had been feeling overwhelmed by school and other things. She wanted space to get back on her feet and be in the right head space mentally. We’ve only been on the break for 2 days, but I’ve been thinking about how much of my life is consumed by our relationship. I love her, I love spending time time her, and I’m happy with her. We’ve been together for about 1 year and 4 months. Ever since we got together, she has been my main focus besides myself. I’ve hung out with my friends less and less. I’ve never been much of a social guy, only kept a few friends. They themselves got lives and it gets harder to organize hanging out. I also spend most of my money on her with dates, food, and whenever we hang out. \nMy question is if the cons outweigh the pros of being in the relationship, should I break up with her even though I love her?\n\nWe make a good and healthy team, we talk after we argue and we’ve learned to compromise at our differences. So the relationship isn’t even toxic. It’s just that I don’t think it’s a good idea to love somebody to the point where she’s my everything. Is that even healthy ?\n\nI’m still young. I don’t think my views on love is mature yet. I always thought that to love somebody is to become one. In doing so, taking care of them, sacrificing for them, and putting them first. (Now that I’m writing this, I think part of it is that both of us shouldn’t be ready to do that at our age).\n\nIs it safer to end the relationship now to avoid “burning out” from young love?","completion":"There are no breakes. There is breaking up and being together. You can break up and get back together but breaking up and promising each other to get pack together is bullshit.   \n\n\nIf you already are not the most social you need to treat your friends well even when you have a relationship. You will loose the few that you have and the friends that you make at a younger age are the ones that might stay forever. Also spending all your money on her is wrong. I think its fine of men pay for the first date(s) but once you are in a commited relationship both parties should pay their part. It does not need to be 50-50 if you earn different amounts of money but both parties need to pay some.   \n\n\nYou do not need to break up since you are already broken up. You can call it a break or whatever you want but its pretty much the same.  \n\n\nI would love to find a partner that I can love as my everything but I would want that person to love me back similarly. Then this is probably a beatiful thing. However if you put her on a pedestal and she does not treat you as good it won't last anyways.   \n\n\nIf you think its not on equal terms you should \"break up\". However I would not have a big talk if you are already \"on a break\". Just treat it like being broken up and if she comes and wants to get back together you tell her that you thought about it and that you want to do things differently."},{"prompt":"My ex(21f) asked me (21m) to give up rights to my daughter (No legal advice just moral advice) Me and my ex were together for almost 2 years and we decided to have a child together. Everything was great then I cheated on her while she was pregnant and ruined the relationship. We stayed together for our daughter so she wouldn’t have a single parent to take care of her. Obviously things weren’t the same anymore and i felt like me being there after I cheated wasn’t fair to my ex. I know what I did was wrong and I’m not making excuses.  My ex is the perfect example of a mother the only things that go on in her mind are about our daughter. I on the other hand was far less involved, any free time I would help the best I could but some times I didn’t help as much as she wanted. After more fighting I decided that my ex and daughter would be happier if I wasn’t there. We worked out child support and visitation 1/2 times a week. It’s been about 7 months since then and my ex texted me and said I’m a pos and my daughter deserves a better life and that I won’t be consistently in her life. She just wants my daughter to have a good family life. If I give up my rights and disappear she’ll almost 100% be better off without me. I have so much love for my daughter that I want to still be there for her but it’s not what she needs. I’m lost and don’t know what to do\n\n(TLDR I cheated on my ex while she was pregnant and now deciding on if I should give up my rights","completion":"You're both very young and raising children at any age is very difficult, that being said you need to step it up.
