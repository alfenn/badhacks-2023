{"prompt":"I(22F) don't want my bf(21M) to watch porn I know this is a very unpopular opinion and I'm going to be called controlling, but I have to ask about this because my heart is breaking.\n\nFor some background, we have been together for six months, we don't live together but I spend most of the time at his place. I have a higher sex drive than his, to the point we'd have sex 10 times a day if it were up to me and I'm also adventurous in bed, I am up to try anything and I have never refused any wish of his. I have been called beautiful many times in my life, by boys, girls, teachers, cashiers, doctors, you name it. He told me mine are the biggest boobs he's seen naked(not that he is very experienced, but it was nice to hear) and that he likes my big butt. I've also had compliments before about my flat stomach and small waist. My hair is almost down to my tailbone and it's healthy and thick. I'm not saying these things to be arrogant, a lot of the time I dislike the way I look and I'd change a million things. My point is that by society's standards and also by his standards I'm good looking and it's not like he has any reason to be unsatisfied with the way I am sexually. So the question is, why am I not enough?\n\nI don't have a problem with masturbation, I get off too but without any material, in my mind I am watching a sex scene between two generic humans, fuzzy faces, nobody specific, just bodies and the two important organs. I wouldn't have a problem with erotica either, it's the explicit visual content that bothers me. I'm not asking him to adhere to a standard I don't hold myself to. He said that sex with me can be a chore which made me really upset, because rubbing one out to naked strangers is not a chore. I guess that would be because he wants to please me as I hive a higher sex drive. When I'm not around he masturbates two times a day, so I don't know why he doesn't find me good enough to want to have sex with as much or more. I've told him about my problem with porn and he called me crazy and controlling but I still think that in a couple sex should be about the two of them, not the two of them and thousands of naked women. In the past he said he would never want to have sex with another woman because he just wants one and one is enough, but apparently this is not true. Even on the days he knows I am coming he still masturbates before I get there.\n\nHe said it's something he can't not do, but what does that say about him in regards to sexual discipline? Also, he told me that all men watch porn, which I know is not true, and if they don't watch porn they're losers, which to me seems very simple-minded. He's generally a nice guy and I love him so I don't want to break up with him, I don't even think I could, but this thing is tearing me apart. Another thing that speaks to his attitude about this subject is that he used to comment pretty crass things on TikTok. He is a gym bro and commented \"I wish I was that platform\" on a video with a girl who peed herself doing deadlifts, \"mommy\" and \"don't ask me the color of anything\" and things like that. He said those were just jokes and eventually stopped commenting because \"he didn't want me to make a scene\", so not because he genuinely doesn't want to.\n\nI've come to hate myself and to hate that I'm not good enough for him. Please advise, what can I do to make him see things from my point of view?","completion":"This sounds very fake and like you are bragging about how hot and sexy you are to get dms."}

{"prompt":"I (22m) am having a relationship dilemma with gf (19m). Part of it is ranting and part of it is advice seeking, bear with me. I just want somebody to talk to about the matter.\n\nMy gf (19f) and I (22m) are currently on a break. She had ask for one since she had been feeling overwhelmed by school and other things. She wanted space to get back on her feet and be in the right head space mentally. We’ve only been on the break for 2 days, but I’ve been thinking about how much of my life is consumed by our relationship. I love her, I love spending time time her, and I’m happy with her. We’ve been together for about 1 year and 4 months. Ever since we got together, she has been my main focus besides myself. I’ve hung out with my friends less and less. I’ve never been much of a social guy, only kept a few friends. They themselves got lives and it gets harder to organize hanging out. I also spend most of my money on her with dates, food, and whenever we hang out. \nMy question is if the cons outweigh the pros of being in the relationship, should I break up with her even though I love her?\n\nWe make a good and healthy team, we talk after we argue and we’ve learned to compromise at our differences. So the relationship isn’t even toxic. It’s just that I don’t think it’s a good idea to love somebody to the point where she’s my everything. Is that even healthy ?\n\nI’m still young. I don’t think my views on love is mature yet. I always thought that to love somebody is to become one. In doing so, taking care of them, sacrificing for them, and putting them first. (Now that I’m writing this, I think part of it is that both of us shouldn’t be ready to do that at our age).\n\nIs it safer to end the relationship now to avoid “burning out” from young love?","completion":"There are no breakes. There is breaking up and being together. You can break up and get back together but breaking up and promising each other to get pack together is bullshit.   \n\n\nIf you already are not the most social you need to treat your friends well even when you have a relationship. You will loose the few that you have and the friends that you make at a younger age are the ones that might stay forever. Also spending all your money on her is wrong. I think its fine of men pay for the first date(s) but once you are in a commited relationship both parties should pay their part. It does not need to be 50-50 if you earn different amounts of money but both parties need to pay some.   \n\n\nYou do not need to break up since you are already broken up. You can call it a break or whatever you want but its pretty much the same.  \n\n\nI would love to find a partner that I can love as my everything but I would want that person to love me back similarly. Then this is probably a beatiful thing. However if you put her on a pedestal and she does not treat you as good it won't last anyways.   \n\n\nIf you think its not on equal terms you should \"break up\". However I would not have a big talk if you are already \"on a break\". Just treat it like being broken up and if she comes and wants to get back together you tell her that you thought about it and that you want to do things differently."}
{"prompt":"My ex(21f) asked me (21m) to give up rights to my daughter (No legal advice just moral advice) Me and my ex were together for almost 2 years and we decided to have a child together. Everything was great then I cheated on her while she was pregnant and ruined the relationship. We stayed together for our daughter so she wouldn’t have a single parent to take care of her. Obviously things weren’t the same anymore and i felt like me being there after I cheated wasn’t fair to my ex. I know what I did was wrong and I’m not making excuses.  My ex is the perfect example of a mother the only things that go on in her mind are about our daughter. I on the other hand was far less involved, any free time I would help the best I could but some times I didn’t help as much as she wanted. After more fighting I decided that my ex and daughter would be happier if I wasn’t there. We worked out child support and visitation 1/2 times a week. It’s been about 7 months since then and my ex texted me and said I’m a pos and my daughter deserves a better life and that I won’t be consistently in her life. She just wants my daughter to have a good family life. If I give up my rights and disappear she’ll almost 100% be better off without me. I have so much love for my daughter that I want to still be there for her but it’s not what she needs. I’m lost and don’t know what to do\n\n(TLDR I cheated on my ex while she was pregnant and now deciding on if I should give up my rights","completion":"You're both very young and raising children at any age is very difficult, that being said you need to step it up.

I know it was not right from me to act that way, however my feelings took over and I cannot imagine her with someone else. \nSo she wanted to try out some fast food restaurant at the train station and when we were there I told her that I can’t be just friends I simply cannot.

You should leave. Without question. I (33f) became the caregiver for my late husband (45m) 1.5 months into our marriage when he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. It was a brutal battle with cancer that ultimately ended his life just shy of our 7 month mark of marriage. Being the one to care for him, love him, and support him in his final months will forever be one of the greatest - if not the greatest - privileges of my life. Love isn’t about convenience. It isn’t about oneself. It’s truly for better and worse, in sickness and health, regardless of marriage status. Choose your partner wisely. She’s told you exactly who she is. I would never be with someone who wouldn’t be willing to love and care for me in the end nor would I be with someone who wouldn’t allow me to do the same for them. Caregiving is incredibly difficult and not for everyone, but I do believe it’s essential to a healthy and loving partnership."}

She looks at least 10 years older than she is.  Her back scans look like a Topsy turvey cake,  literally her vertibert are collapsing on top of each other.  The constant pounding on pavement has destroyed her joints (she ran marathons). I can't count the number of surgeries she's had due to wear and tear on hey body from this.  In fact she just had a hip replacement that they had to do before they could start to fix her back (she's already had 3 spinal fusions) and less than 2 weeks out she's again riding her bike against medical advice.  After her first spinal fusion in which she almost died, she left the hospital,  rode her bike to a race and ran a half marathon.  I wish I was kidding.  If she cannot get a handle on this now. She won't,  and your daughter will follow suit.  My mom has gone to countless eating disorder rehabs, but started so late into her disorder she would always leave.

{"prompt":"My (38m) friend is acting shady about my gf (41f) (update below original post)\n\nBackground: \n\nI have a married friend, let's call him Bob, who I have known for about 4 years. Bob is my cousin's best friend. He knew my gf before I met her, but they were never close, just acquainted. Bob cheats on his wife religiously, which I really do not like; I tolerate him because of my cousin. He has sent inappropriate text messages to my gf on a few occasions, and I have told him that we don't appreciate it. Bob's wife was out of town the weekend of the following event. \n\nEdit:\n- Bob has gf's number because gf's daughter worked at his restaurant.\n- I have not personally observed Bob cheating on his wife. I have been told by my cousin that \"Bob is out here banging women like he's single.\" I don't question it, because why would my cousin lie about that. \n\nThe event in question:\n\nI met up with a bunch of friends to go out for my birthday. Bob asked where my gf was; I told him that she stayed home, and we would go out alone the following day. He said \"cool, I'm going out with some old friends tonight, but I'll meet up with you guys after.\" He never met up with us; no big deal.\n\nThe next day, I took my gf out to dinner. We were talking, and she asked if Bob was drunk last night. I said \"probably, but I don't know. He went out with some old friends.\" She then showed me text messages that he sent her -- most of them were just stupid banter, but there were two that did not sit well with me. They read:\n\n\"Hey, call me when you're free\"\n\"But only tonight 😉\"\n\nShe didn't respond to him, and he eventually just said \"happy new year.\" She thought Bob went out with me, and we were just messing with her. After I told her that he didn't, she felt very uncomfortable about these messages. She also was not aware that Bob's wife was out of town that weekend.\n\nI texted Bob, \"Hey Bob, I think there has been a misunderstanding. I would like to remind you that [gf] is my girlfriend, and we are exclusive. This is the last time I'm going to say this.\" Bob responded, \"Good for you guys, but I don't know why you're telling me this.\" About a minute later, he sent another message, \"I don't need this drama. I'm going to block you both. You guys need to get your story straight before you come at me.\" This response bothered me; this told me that he knew exactly why I was messaging him, and he knew it was dirty. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Bob sent another text to my gf -- \"what did you tell [me]?\" My gf did not respond, and she blocked his number and social media accounts. \n\nBob told my cousin something about this event, I'm not sure what and don't really care. He's my cousin's friend and I don't want to interfere with their relationship, but I did show him the messages and told him that Bob crossed a line. My cousin is trying to maintain both relationships, so he is trying to convince me that it isn't what it seems. He told me that he thinks my gf is trying to emotionally manipulate me because she doesn't like Bob. \n\nTo me, it looks like Bob tried to take advantage of the fact that his wife was out of town and my gf was alone. I am convinced, based on the circumstances, that he would have slept with my gf had she been willing. Am I being insecure/ overreacting? Does this just seem like innocent banter, or do you think I'm making the right call?\n\n\n**********[UPDATE]**********\n\nBefore I begin, I would just like to reiterate how much I appreciate everyone's input on my original post. You all took the time to give me your opinions, and I want you all to know that I heard and felt that, even if I seemed resistant to some suggestions, and even if we didn't see eye to eye. The community rules only allow for one update, so I suppose this will be the last one on this topic... If anyone is interested in the ultimate outcome, feel free to message me. \n\nI had another conversation with my cousin, and had a very long conversation with my gf about this. I did not mention anything about a reddit post, or consensus on how I should proceed... That's not really my style. \n\nWhat I did do is warn my cousin that I'm considering telling his wife about this, and advised him to distance himself from Bob for the sake of his own marriage. I said \"I don't know what you guys do together, and I would hate for your wife to associate you with cheating if you've done nothing.\" He says he will, but I don't believe him. What he does at this point is on his shoulders, not mine. \n\nAfter discussing at length the pros and cons of telling his wife with my gf, we have decided that we should probably tell her. Neither of us wants to do it, but my gf believes that it should be her that breaks the news. They are both from the same country, and have a lot of cultural similarities; she is also the one who was approached and harassed by Bob. Our hope is that the news will be better received and understood coming from her. I will be present, but solely for her safety. \n\nI have not spoken to my father about this yet, but I plan to. I don't want to create any extra drama, but feel like there will be some bullshit coming out of this and he should probably have a heads up. \n\nTL; DR, we all know that Bob is a giant piece of shit.

{"prompt":"My (38m) friend is acting shady about my gf (41f) (update below original post)\n\nBackground: \n\nI have a married friend, let's call him Bob, who I have known for about 4 years. Bob is my cousin's best friend. He knew my gf before I met her, but they were never close, just acquainted. Bob cheats on his wife religiously, which I really do not like; I tolerate him because of my cousin. He has sent inappropriate text messages to my gf on a few occasions, and I have told him that we don't appreciate it. Bob's wife was out of town the weekend of the following event. \n\nEdit:\n- Bob has gf's number because gf's daughter worked at his restaurant.\n- I have not personally observed Bob cheating on his wife. I have been told by my cousin that \"Bob is out here banging women like he's single.\" I don't question it, because why would my cousin lie about that. \n\nThe event in question:\n\nI met up with a bunch of friends to go out for my birthday. Bob asked where my gf was; I told him that she stayed home, and we would go out alone the following day. He said \"cool, I'm going out with some old friends tonight, but I'll meet up with you guys after.\" He never met up with us; no big deal.\n\nThe next day, I took my gf out to dinner. We were talking, and she asked if Bob was drunk last night. I said \"probably, but I don't know. He went out with some old friends.\" She then showed me text messages that he sent her -- most of them were just stupid banter, but there were two that did not sit well with me. They read:\n\n\"Hey, call me when you're free\"\n\"But only tonight 😉\"\n\nShe didn't respond to him, and he eventually just said \"happy new year.\" She thought Bob went out with me, and we were just messing with her. After I told her that he didn't, she felt very uncomfortable about these messages. She also was not aware that Bob's wife was out of town that weekend.\n\nI texted Bob, \"Hey Bob, I think there has been a misunderstanding. I would like to remind you that [gf] is my girlfriend, and we are exclusive. This is the last time I'm going to say this.\" Bob responded, \"Good for you guys, but I don't know why you're telling me this.\" About a minute later, he sent another message, \"I don't need this drama. I'm going to block you both. You guys need to get your story straight before you come at me.\" This response bothered me; this told me that he knew exactly why I was messaging him, and he knew it was dirty. \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, Bob sent another text to my gf -- \"what did you tell [me]?\" My gf did not respond, and she blocked his number and social media accounts. \n\nBob told my cousin something about this event, I'm not sure what and don't really care. He's my cousin's friend and I don't want to interfere with their relationship, but I did show him the messages and told him that Bob crossed a line. My cousin is trying to maintain both relationships, so he is trying to convince me that it isn't what it seems. He told me that he thinks my gf is trying to emotionally manipulate me because she doesn't like Bob. \n\nTo me, it looks like Bob tried to take advantage of the fact that his wife was out of town and my gf was alone. I am convinced, based on the circumstances, that he would have slept with my gf had she been willing. Am I being insecure/ overreacting? Does this just seem like innocent banter, or do you think I'm making the right call?\n\n\n**********[UPDATE]**********\n\nBefore I begin, I would just like to reiterate how much I appreciate everyone's input on my original post. You all took the time to give me your opinions, and I want you all to know that I heard and felt that, even if I seemed resistant to some suggestions, and even if we didn't see eye to eye. The community rules only allow for one update, so I suppose this will be the last one on this topic... If anyone is interested in the ultimate outcome, feel free to message me. \n\nI had another conversation with my cousin, and had a very long conversation with my gf about this. I did not mention anything about a reddit post, or consensus on how I should proceed... That's not really my style. \n\nWhat I did do is warn my cousin that I'm considering telling his wife about this, and advised him to distance himself from Bob for the sake of his own marriage. I said \"I don't know what you guys do together, and I would hate for your wife to associate you with cheating if you've done nothing.\" He says he will, but I don't believe him. What he does at this point is on his shoulders, not mine. \n\nAfter discussing at length the pros and cons of telling his wife with my gf, we have decided that we should probably tell her. Neither of us wants to do it, but my gf believes that it should be her that breaks the news. They are both from the same country, and have a lot of cultural similarities; she is also the one who was approached and harassed by Bob. Our hope is that the news will be better received and understood coming from her. I will be present, but solely for her safety. \n\nI have not spoken to my father about this yet, but I plan to. I don't want to create any extra drama, but feel like there will be some bullshit coming out of this and he should probably have a heads up. \n\nTL; DR, we all know that Bob is a giant piece of shit. You guys told me that I should tell his wife, and I heard you. His wife will know soon.","completion":"Show bobs wife the texts.  Fuck that asshole"}

This abusive behaviour often ‘works’ and serves a purpose as you get what you want. For example, if you’ve ever been moody or aggressive about your partner going out for the night with friends, they may not go out next time they’re invited.**\n\n(Emphasis added.

Have a third party ask questions. \n\nDon’t get into funding his business. It’s probably unwise because you become a business partner and if it fails or goes sideways you both have extra resentment. \n\nTalk about how you see both your lives. How you both want to handle money, goals, children, future.  What you both want from the relationship. Are you really both on the same page? Talk it out."}
{"prompt":"Old friend (25F) reached out to reconnect with me (25M) how can I gently tell her I don’t want to? Going to try and keep this post short and too the point. A friend from high school reached out and in a not very subtle way hinted that she’s trying to reconnect with lost friends. Her reason for this is that she’s felt very lonely, like her existence was forgotten. Aside from her boyfriend and family she’s got no one on a friendship level. Back when I know her she was a bit unhinged social type. Bounced from boyfriend to boyfriend and was very reliant on others to fix her personal issues. Lots of friend, but few lasting connections. \n\nHonestly there’s no reason not to and in all likelihood shes matured a lot from  when I used to know her. But I have no desire to reconnect with her. I feel like an asshole to leave her in a time of need but I don’t have any obligations to fulfil. So I want to be gentle about this, no dragging it out and if possible avoid hurting her feelings. What can I do?","completion":"What is with these men that think normal human interactions are disrespecting them?

{"prompt":"I (28F) want to take my newborn and leave my husband (32M) We had only been together for two years and married for a little over year. I got pregnant four months after getting engaged. All this is to say that we don’t have a lot of time together under our belt. Before I gave birth to my son, his job was stable and his emotions too. After I gave birth, I had PPD and PPA coupled with the fact that he has a lot of stress at work. He has always had a temper but it became more and more frequent, and I became less and less tolerating to him snapping at me. We always make up at the end though within a few hours. \n\nHis mom came to live with us to help last month, and our relationship had plummeted since. MIL treats her son like a king and expects me to do the same. She is implicit enough but always insinuating. (“It is a wife’s duty to do so and so…”) She even cries when her son is working a 60-hour work week and being stressed at work. So he gradually decreases the time helping out with the baby and with housework (he still does, but not as much). His anger is also getting worse. \n\nPart of this is because of the MIL but I don’t know that it wont continue after she is gone (in 5 months!!) and I don’t want to be the one to tell her to leave.

I brought it up and he denied that he would ever do that, but it has still left me feeling insecure and doubting the strength of our connection.\n\nNot sure what to do or what to think. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks :)","completion":"OP, I already read the comments and your replies and since I don't want to repeat any of the smart things already said, I just want to talk about something that seems small, but stuck out to me: Your wife exploring the possibility of having \"psychic powers\", and, a tiny bit, gaming. \n\nYour wife sounds, overall, like a grounded person. You said the stressful job she quit involved sick people, so I assume that she believes in modern medicine and the like. You also expressed in a comment that you are pretty baffled where this came from.\n\nI think it basically came from a place close to where the gaming comes from: Fleeing from reality because of great unhappiness. Games distract you. They put you into an interactive world which isn't sucky reality, but where you can, no matter what sort of game you play, win. \n\nPsychic powers would be an equally cool win. Imagine you would have the magic powers to make all your problems go away! No matter what psychic powers she thinks she may have, it's bound to be useful. Read minds? Magically move objects around? Talk to ghosts? Heal people? All of that can definitely be used to earn money easily. It also implies doing things \"easily\" - just think about something and it's done. No stress, no exhaustion. Easier. Happier. Bound to get her admiration and attention. Everything reality doesn't seem to be right now.\n\nDon't we all dream like that sometimes, in good and bad ways? Don't we imagine what we would buy if we suddenly had a million dollars? Don't we something think if it wouldn't be cool if the horrible boss we hate would just fall down the stairs and break his neck, never to bother us again? Don't we dream our dead loved ones would come back and hug us one more time when we are miserable? Don't we imagine how it would be to constantly live in the place we have a wonderful vacation at? In my opinion, her sudden dreams of psychic powers come from such a place. And the fact that she is actively trying to believe in it shows, in my opinion, how deeply unhappy she is. She is clinging to something so crazy to escape her current life because she sees no other way out. She's stuck. Miserable. And you, the one around her, are the one feeling her misery. The more miserable she gets, the more you feel her unhappiness. \n\nThe question is: Where does that misery come from? Is it because you kind of dragged her down because you are cranky? Is she actually suffering from depression because she is now at home so much and lacks the social interactions with coworkers?\n\nOr, maybe, it's because she doesn't really know what to do, job-wise. Maybe she doesn't feel like anything is fun, after having had two jobs she quit and also not really feeling like turning a hobby into a career (which is often smart - having to do something for a living can suck all joy out of it and creativity is hard to force when you don't feel like doing it). Maybe she tossed herself into the \"role\" of your caretaker simply because it meant that she could forget about the job thing for a while - and then, instead of being happy with that, you put the finger into the wound by telling her that she needs to worry less about you and more about what she needs to do with her life. Maybe worrying about you was her way to escape that needed thought.\n\nI personally would recommend therapy. Both couples counselling since it's clear that you two right now drag each other down and your communication got lost somewhere along the way, but also individual counselling for her. Gaming and psychic powers point me towards a depression at least brewing in the background and I feel like a neutral party could also help her sort herself out so that she can decide better what she wants out of life."}

For example I gave her a smartwatch in her favorite color for Christmas and even though I earn a lot more than her, I expect a Christmas present in return which I still have not gotten and she's told me she doubts she'll give me one. I've told her I don't want anything expensive or anything and have suggested a bra strap bracelet, because it would make me very happy. There have been other smaller instances for example me trying to work on things and communicate, but she has a hard time changing her behavior. She has a friend who is motivating her to be disrespectful towards me and even though it's gotten better, I'm sure it'll happen again. I feel like I give and give and give and she takes and takes and takes. A on-sided relationship, if you will.\n\n\n\nShe's a horse girl and I'm just a guy who's hobby is working out and doing whatever project I feel like doing (preserving insects, woodworking, whatever). She wants to have a farm with horses and i want to become a doctor and live in a house in the city. Shw wants to move to Sweden for the next 3 or so years to get a degree in that field to become professional and I want to stay in Denmark and pursue my career as a doctor. Our futures don't align very well but I feel in my gut there is a solution and a way to fix the problem.\nShe is not a very sexual person, which I respect and don't have a problem with. I do have a problem with the fact that she's not willing to learn or experiment with new things (still pretty vanilla things) when she does want to do sexual things. It frustrates me a lot.\n\nShe's a great person overall, but these and a couple smaller things are ruining our relationship and I'm considering breaking up with her.\n\nI'm looking for a solution to these problems and inspiration from people in different situations. Thank you in advance","completion":"Some of this kind of comes off as you minimizing her feelings and perspective a little bit, to be honest. I know that's not intentional, but, \nthe \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and \"it's worth noting she's never really dated\" and \"she's basing this off one just okay date\" and \"is it worth going deeper in my feelings\" all just kind of make it seem like you're invalidating her perspective.\n\nThere's really nothing else to do, she's made it clear. I wouldn't recommend mentioning anything about if she changes her mind or that you want to talk about things. For some people, one date is more than enough time to determine they aren't into someone else. If she knows, she knows.\n\nI would let it go and move on. She knows her own feelings better than anyone else."}
{"prompt":"Man(36M) that I(24F) started seeing might be using a false identity. Let's start this off by disclaiming that my social skills are not the best and I often find myself unable to detect lies or other red flags.\n\nSo I've(24F) been seeing a man(36M) for a short while now. He owns a repair business, and the first time I met him was when my laptop broke and I came to his store to have him take a look at it. We ended up talking for a long time whenever I stopped by, and after an appropriate amount of time after my laptop was fixed his texts became more flirty, and I thought 'why not' since he's very kind, smart, good-looking, and just found him a relatable and pleasant person in general. A few days ago I went home with him for the first time, but the more I think about it the more I start to wonder about a few odd details... \n\nThe first thing that got me wondering was that apparently he uses 2 names... As we were ordering food his details got auto-filled with a name I had never seen before. I asked him jokingly if this was his alter ego, but his answer was that it was the same name but the one I had met him as was simply adjusted to dutch spelling. Now for his first name this would kind of(still not a lot) make sense, as the pronunciation would be the same, even though the spelling was completely different. However the surnames were too different to apply that same logic to. I've tried googling his actual name but everything to be found online about this man is all under his 'dutch name'. (Yes, I've tried going stalker mode before turning to Reddit for advice) \n\nThere are more small details that make this a bit weirder though; his 'dutch' name, isn't Dutch at all, it's actually a very stereotypical name for a specific (non-dutch) nationality (Apologies for my vagueness but I don't want people from the same city to put 2 and 2 together if this guy maybe changed his name for safety issues). Just think of for example 'John Smith' for Americans.  \n\nThen things got weirder when I opened YouTube on his TV and all recommendations for video's were in Arabic. (\\*Sidenote; I don't give a shit about where someone is from, with the only exception being if someone were to be from my hometown) I asked: 'oooh what's this?' , but then it took very long for him to respond and I felt like he was feeling uncomfortable (not sure though since body language is not my strong suit) so I moved to a different topic because I want people to feel the opposite of uncomfortable :/\n\nAnother thing that made me think was his age. If the age he told me he was is correct, then he must be a fucking genius. His LinkedIn showed the year in which he started university, which would have been at age 15. I asked him about this, and didn't get a very satisfying answer. Just that he was an exception and when I asked further I just got a jokey response and the conversation was successfully shifted to a different topic. I don't think there is malicious intent involved, but it sure didn't help to ease my doubts.\n\nLastly; the night I went home with him he kept being called on his phone by the same contact. He said it was an 80yr old man who was lonely and would often try calling him (which I could believe, seeing his kind and approachable personality), but the same contact called after midnight as well and again at 8am the next morning. He never answered it. \n\nI don't want to cross any boundaries here.. Everyone is entitled to their privacy and I want people to be free to share personal things only whenever they feel comfortable enough without having to be pushed, but I also don't want to be an idiot that is oblivious to red flags. How do I go from here? Do I bring it up again? Is there a specific way in which I could phrase my questions that could maybe get more satisfying answers? Am I maybe overthinking and is this not that weird? Or is there a completely innocent explanation for this that I'm simply missing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR : man I started seeing seems to be using multiple names and is possibly lying about his age.","completion":"Should the buddy bits not also be clean?

{"prompt":"I (24F) just found out my coworkers wrongly think I enabled an affair between my sister (21F) and a coworker(22M) behind his ex’s back and have been blackballing me because of it. What do I do? Tl;dr: my sister started dating my coworker shortly after my coworker’s breakup with another coworker, even though I explicitly was against them getting together so soon. No one told me everyone thought poorly of me, it’s been a year. What do I do?\n\n\nI work in tech retail, and have around 90 coworkers. We are very tight knit, and got along very well. I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it. I feel so stupid, and it may sound stupid but to realize how many relationships in my life may have just been fake- how do I continue living? This is a nightmare and I just want out.  What do I even do now?","completion":"I would actually start addressing it. I know it’s awkward and uncomfortable if you don’t want to do it. However, you can do it may be one person at a time because I’m sure you noticed that people you liked. You were friends with stop being friends with you. So that’s a good place to start with one person. And I would just tell the story you know I was talking to so-and-so the other day and they said that people thought that I had something to do with Bill and Mira whatever the story is. And say frankly, I was totally surprised because I had no idea and I did not do that. Bring it up in conversation. And see how it goes. Communication is the most important tool with your friends. And most people like weird people I do. But your inability to communicate directly to people may cause you issues so I would learn how to do that a little bit. And good luck to you."}

And that she lost all her other friends from that time.\n\nShe was grateful that I had given her a \"free return ticket\" but also respected (at least in retrospect) that I had not stayed around to put up with her crappy behaviour.\n\nI wish you all the best. You are grieving for your friend who passed away, and also for the end of this friendship now.\n\nYou will get through this, but you have to protect yourself from the trauma-go-round that she's inflicting on you right now.\n\nYou've got this."}
{"prompt":"I (24F) just found out my coworkers wrongly think I enabled an affair between my sister (21F) and a coworker(22M) behind his ex’s back and have been blackballing me because of it. What do I do? Tl;dr: my sister started dating my coworker shortly after my coworker’s breakup with another coworker, even though I explicitly was against them getting together so soon. No one told me everyone thought poorly of me, it’s been a year. What do I do?\n\n\nI work in tech retail, and have around 90 coworkers. We are very tight knit, and got along very well. I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it. I feel so stupid, and it may sound stupid but to realize how many relationships in my life may have just been fake- how do I continue living? This is a nightmare and I just want out.  What do I even do now?","completion":"Completely agreed. It will do no one, OP included, any good to just be a punching bag for the friend while she's in this abusive relationship; if OP so wishes, it's good to make sure the friend, like you said, knows there's a helping hand if she needs it, but the friendship itself needs to go on a break in the meanwhile.\n\nThe friend may or may not reach out, and she may or may not be grateful, but that's a whole other story. Right now, OP needs to do what's best for herself, it's hard to keep someone else warm while you yourself are shivering in the dark."}

Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them.

Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January.

I started working there around 16 months ago. I became friends with one coworker (22M), we will call Bill. Bill would hang out together with my husband and I, and the three of us became quite close. Eventually, Bill started in a relationship with my other coworker, we will call Lyla (19F). It is important to note as well that I specifically asked Bill if he had considered starting anything with Lyla because I thought she was great and seemed clearly interested. They started dating around December. They seemed excellent together, everyone seemed happy, but then seemingly out of the blue, Bill broke up with Lyla after 3 months. Bill said he had some inner work to do, to fix himself and stuff he was dealing with, and he felt like he needed to be alone to do that, and wouldn’t be able to properly address his issues while in a relationship. This was surprising, but neither of them directly mentioned it to me, and I didnt want to be nosy or involved where I wasn’t invited so I didn’t bring it up to either of them. Hanging out with Bill had understandably dropped off while he was dating Lyla, so at this point I also didnt feel close enough to pry. At this point, it is probably worth it to mention that I have autism, so I dont always pick up on social cues in the way everyone else might. At this point though, no one knew this.  \n\nBill began hanging out with my husband again, and the three of us plus a few friends started to hang out routinely again. My husband was kind of acting like a mentor to Bill as he tried to sort his stuff out.  We would do some trivia nights at local breweries. Several weeks later, around 4-6, we invited my sister (21F) to a trivia night. Everyone had fun, nothing seemed weird, we went home.  It is worth it to mention that my sister had recently just gotten divorced in December. This was in the last week of March or mid April, I truly cannot remember. \n\nA couple weeks later we went out again, and my sister and Bill really hit it off. Bill clearly seemed interested, but my sister, I wasnt sure about. After that evening, I found out they made plans to watch all of star wars together over the next few weeks. She started staying over there, and I asked if anything was happening, and she said no, they strictly stayed in different rooms. I told her with everything being so fresh for both if them I felt like this was a bad idea and kind of disrespectful to his ex. I told both if them that J could see a world where they would get on really well together, but they both needed to take a break from dating and seriously work on themselves. Long story short that did not happen, within a few weeks they were dating. And honestly, as frustrating as it was initially, they seemed really, really happy together and honestly pretty good for each other. They moved VERY quickly, and throughout the process I kept mentioning to be considerate of what they post on social media and also just to slow down because they were committing and moving at a lightning pace. \n\n8 months later, after what was a mostly fine relationship, Bill breaks up with my sister in January. He gives the same reason he gave Lyla. Which honestly I believe him- he has shit to work on that clearly he cannot do in the context of a relationship. My sister is devastated, but they move on after the next couple of weeks. \n\nIt’s been about 3 weeks since that happened. Tonight, I went out for drinks with some of my coworkers. They mentioned another coworker (We’ll call Sarah) who was not present, and I confessed to them that i felt like she didnt like me.  One of my coworkers said “OP, come on, you’ve got to know.” \nI was blind sided and said I had no idea what she was talking about. My coworker told me that ever since my sister and Bill had gotten together, “everyone” thought I was shady I that I didn’t tell Lyla myself because the timespan was so short that clearly my sister and Bill must have been fucking behind Lyla’s  back, or at least had something going on and I should have told Lyla the truth.\n\nI was so unbelievably blindsided. This was the first time in a full calendar year that anyone had said something to me about it. People have been talking about me poorly for a full year about something that simply isn’t true. Like I said, I have 90 coworkers. Possibly close to 100 people I know and care about have been thinking this and said nothing. Those who were there also thought they started dating 2 weeks after Lyla and Bill broke up. They didn’t even MEET for a full month after that, and I still felt like it was too soon. \n\nWhat is the worst part is around that time last year, people started being weird to me. I was left out of group chats, people stopped making eye contact with me, or stopped talking to me. For reference, I can be pretty awkward. I have ADHD and Autism and mask it very well. So when people started dropping off for me, I assumed it was because people started seeing through my masking and decided I was too weird to be friends with.  I have weeped to my husband and therapist for months about how my awkwardness has cost me friendships at work, and how broken I feel because I thought it was all due to something I couldn’t change about myself. Now I know that at least part of it is due to a fucking rumor, a fucking lie. \n\nI cannot say how devastating this is. I dont know how to even go into work tomorrow. This is my worst nightmare. Those with ASD might be able to imagine how this is my worst nightmare come to life. It feels too late to bring it up to fix it. I feel so stupid, and it may sound stupid but to realize how many relationships in my life may have just been fake- how do I continue living? This is a nightmare and I just want out.  What do I even do now?","completion":"Yes, yes you should.\n\nI just got out of a four year relationship with an addict and this behaviour will only escalate. He started off stealing my weed slowly over time, gaslit me into thinking it was my housemate which culminated in a complete breakdown of our relationship and her moving out suddenly, leaving me to pay her rent and bills. He even bought a motion sensor for my room to ensure I didn't suspect him.\n\nHe continued to steal my cannabis, and then started taking my ADHD medication. Watched me go through withdrawals and the stress of thinking I'd somehow abused my meds. He did a similar thing of 'being the good guy' by sourcing more meds for me whilst not telling me it was him who took them in the first place. \n\nFinally, he stole a whole box of my pain meds the day after my grandpa died. Couldn't gaslight me outta catching that one because I knew I'd just filled the prescription. \n\nDon't be me, it's so much harder to get out once you're deep in. He's showing you who he is and this is before you've built a solid foundation of trust. He will abuse that trust, he already is. Get out now."}

{"prompt":"1.5 Years Just Gone (21M) (20F) We dated for 1 year and 4 months, together 1 year and 5 months if you don’t count official dating time.

By 6:00 she was like, “Nope, I’m done, not more talking,” and then finally fully kicked me out at around 7:45 PM. It seemed really promising we could work something out at this point. Sunday night we called for  hours, Monday night we FaceTimed for 1 hour. At this point we were on a break but still planned on being with each other and moving to a different state in eight months. Tuesday night was a 10 minute call to say we’re fully broken up. She said we could block each other, be friends, or FwB. I pushed for exclusive FwB after this. She ignored me and gave me short answers for the most part Wednesday and Thursday. Really late at night she called me up and said we weren’t going to have sex one last time or maintain an exclusive sexual relationship or even a FwB situation one. She said now we were completely broken up, and that tomorrow (Friday) we’d give all of our stuff back, talk for a little bit, and then leave. \n\n\nWe talked for about 45 minutes on Friday at around 11:00 AM.

She said she wasn’t, she said that all of her emotion had gone away. She said the first two days were like an adjustment period but that she was happy being free, and wasn’t sad anymore. I begged her to be honest, that if anything in her was still upset she could say so. I’ve been handling this break up terribly up until now, self harm, not eating, drinking, thoughts of suicide. I’ve even picked up cigarettes now. (I vape but don’t smoke) I just needed to hear her tell me that she didn’t just go from being here any time I needed to not caring for me at all. I asked her if I could just hold her and cry, she agreed, however it was empty. The girl who I’d been with for a year and a half, the sweet loving women, was now gone. Instead, ahead of me lay a cold hearted person who no longer loves or or cares for me, at least anymore than pity, it was a punch to the gut. She hugged me and let me cry, but it was an empty shallow hug, I not only heard, but now also felt that she no longer cared and was gone. I’d hugged her hundreds of times over the time we dated, and what she gave me yesterday wasn’t that.  She let my cry into her for a bit tho. I held her and I cried profusely. She let me but I felt absolutely no emotion. She was emotionaless the entire time. Not any break in voice, tears, she had no emotion and it was killing me.

{"prompt":"How do I (22F) end things with a guy (23m) who is creeping me out? Hi! A couple months ago I went on a few dates with a guy and they went really well conversationally but I was still unsure about a romanatic connection. In my eyes this was just a couple dates but he started talking about thing’s seriously and bringing his friends to my job (a restaurant) and started trying to move very fast and that kinda helped make up my mind that I wasn’t interested in pursuing a relationship with him. I started to feel guilty bc he seemed very attached. Then I got very sick and the same day my friend passed away. I became very depressed and didn’t want to risk the fallout of ending things with him bc honestly I didn’t want to deal with what it could cause on top of everything else I was feeling and at the point I still wanted to end things in person but was too sick to go out. I sent him a message explaining what I was dealing with and that I needed some space to process. At first it seemed he took it well and I was appreciative and then he came to my work the first day I was back and left me a duffle bag of gifts and a 3 page letter. I thought it was a lot considering we were only barely dating but still very sweet considering I was going through a hard time. I thanked him and talked to him on the phone a bit but it had still only been a few days since my friend had passed at that point and It seemed like he expected leaving me gifts to fix my depression and started inviting me to stuff nonstop with his friends and family and begging me to meet up and talk to him about what I was going through. This felt like a lot. When i’d decline these invitation he started sending really long messages and showed up to my work 2 more times, one time freaking out and shaking and acting strange saying he needed to talk to me and the other time brought me a drink and told me he’s housesitting and asking me to come over which doesn’t make sense to me considering we were not anywhere near a sleepover point in a relationship and had only kissed 1 time when it turned midnight on new years. I also had reminded him I needed more time to have space multiple at the point so it all just felt super forward. At that point I was getting upset and felt smothered and the paragraphs were only getting longer and I decided I was 100% going to end things and I told him 3 days ago very seriously that I needed space and stopped responding to messages and stopped opening all the paragraphs he’d send so I could decide my next course of action. and that brings me to yesterday, my coworker was walking into work and saw him taping something to my car door. I decided to go out and grab it and in the distance I ended up seeing he was parked at another establishment faced toward my work and my car and was watching. For the next hour I could see him watching from the distance. He sent a text saying he dropped something off at my truck but was “too busy” to stop inside and give me a hug. What he had taped to my car was a 4 page letter basically saying the same stuff he had said in previous long messages of him freaking out. My manager knew about the letter and saw part of it and then when I was leaving I told both my managers that he was still parked and watching, they were very worried and considered talking to him to tell him to stop but I didn’t want to escalate the situation and told them I will try to handle it first so instead my manager walked me to my vehicle and then the guy drove off after sitting there for over an hour. I was scared that he saw me walk out with someone and was then going to drive to my house and ambush me there instead but he didn’t thank god. My work is taking this very seriously and they are worried for my safety. They sent out an announcement that people can’t leave the building without a manager knowing and now people can’t go outside to smoke without telling a manager. I feel super bad about all this.

{"prompt":"I (F25) have been seeing (M30) for a few months. I just found out he has a felony charge for strangulation \nUpdate: So I just googled how to find mugshots and I found out it really is him who strangulated someone as well as the other charges... I don't know what to do, I've never been in a situation like this ever... I have some of his stuff currently. My friend suggested that I should tell him what I know and to see his reaction. But my gut is telling me to act like I don't know about the things he has done and get out of this relationship before it gets way too deep. I don't know what he might do if he knows what I know. He previously said how one of his roommates had a felony charge for assault. I'm 100% certain he was trying to gauge my reaction on that sort of thing. I'm scared and I'm really unsure of what I should do... I made a different post just last night but I really need some advice on what I should do. I don't want to put too much information just in case he finds this post.\n\n\n(Post from last night)\nSo I have known this person for a year from work but just started to get to hang out with him regularly since about the end of December of 2022. Everything has been going great and we have been getting along super well. He hasn’t been mean or abusive to me at all. He’s been really sweet tbh. He did start calling me sweets pretty early on which was a little odd but I have a feeling now it could of been love bombing but I could be wrong. Anyway back to the topic I had an instant thought to google his name. I can’t quite remember why I had the thought to google him but I was just curious on what I would find. So I don’t know his middle name but his first and last name match as well as his birthday on the report... so I’m pretty sure it is him that has a felony charge as well as misdemeanor charges against him too. The thing is that the felony is what is pretty scary... He has a charge for strangulation... I don’t know how I should go about ending this relationship... we haven’t officially set a boyfriend or girlfriend label but we already say “love you” to each other. What’s scary is having the feeling that I don’t want to end it because things have been going so well. I know it’s stupid especially since I now know this information about him. But now all my body is telling is that I need to leave before he decides to do this to me. I just don’t know how go about it since I’ve made it clear that I really do like him. I don’t have the excuse that I still like my ex since I told him how my last ex was a dick. I haven’t been afraid of him until finding out this information... He hasn’t made any clear attempts to do anything horrible to me even though we’ve been alone together many different times. But I’m sure it could be because it’s still in the beginning stages... He does know where I live and where I currently work so is their anything I should do to keep myself safe just in case this turns out really bad?","completion":"Your friend gives terrible advice.\n\nYes, tell the guy who has a felony for strangulation that you know and see how he reacts. Outstanding move...\n\nAt least you have braincells:\n\n&gt;I don't know about the things he has done and get out of this relationship before it gets way too deep.\n\nSilently take your exit. And if it ever makes its way into the conversation, make sure its done over a call or text. Not in person.\n\nIf what he said is true about his friend having felony charges as well, that is all the more reason to get far away. That is a bad crowd to get involved with.\n\nWhen you do break it off, maybe try to make your case about you instead, like:\n\n&gt;I have been doing a lot of thinking lately, and we've spent time getting to know each-other. But I have came to realize that I am not ready for a relationship. I need to work on myself and I don't think I even want a relationship in the next couple of years.\n\nEnding it in a civil way. Nothing extreme. You're likely still going to see him around at work so it might take a little more time to phase it out completely.\n\nBut at least you avoid that \"Get away from me!! Blocking you on everything!\" type of conflict. Keep things calm between the two of you and play it off as it you're the problem."}

I miscarried 9 years ago and any and everything having to do with babies completely fucked with me.  Instant bitterness, surface happy for people announcing pregnancies or having kids. Felt alone in the whole thing as my so didn’t take it nearly the same way as I did so I couldn’t really ever bring it up without being mad at him ‘not caring’ the same way I do. When I say I thought about it daily I truly thought about it daily. How old they would be, what they’d look like, what they’d be doing in life, what we would have named them. It doesn’t go away. Grief is a weird, hard thing to deal with but you’ve gotta talk to someone and eventually talk to him about it"}
{"prompt":"I (26f) am jealous of my (32m) boyfriend's relationship with his sister. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this without being judged for it. I'll try to keep it short and sweet. I (26f) have been with my boyfriend (32m) for almost a year. He's a great boyfriend to me, and we are on the same page with most things.\n\nHere's the issue.\nMy older brother passed away about four years ago. It was the worst day of my life, as I watched him pass away suddenly and didn't have time to prepare mentally. He was the closest brother to me. I have three other brothers. Two of them are long distance and there's a huge age gap so we've never been close. And the other brother, we can't stand each other. (Long story). I have a pretty good relationship with the rest of my family; parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. But every since lost the closest brother to me, it feels like I don't have any siblings at all.\n\nMy boyfriend has a really close relationship with his sister, and on the surface, I'm really glad he has that. I know how beautiful that relationship can be because it's very similar to the one I had with my brother. However, deep down, there are a ton of emotions that I can't express to anyone.\nI'm so confused about why I feel so angry inside sometimes. When he tells he stories about them hanging out, or when I see them joking with one another, or just doing anything really, I get emotional. I'll step away and bawl my eyes out in the bathroom, or after I get off of the phone with him, I'll cry myself to sleep. Also, I feel guilty because sometimes I get angry out of nowhere. To him, it looks like I'm being moody or distant. But inside, I'm a mix of sad, angry, jealous, and resentful. I feel so childish and disgusting for having these feelings but I literally cannot turn them off. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should talk to him about it because don't know how he'll take it. Seeing them together makes me feel like a bitter, envious person.\nWhat should I do?","completion":"A somewhat contrarian opinion, but it's worked for me, and I'm old and have had many relationships of all kinds: from romantic, to friendships, to those defying definitions.\n\nAnd here's my advice: there's nothing wrong with putting your heart and telling people how you feel. This applies both to your situation and any situations where you are the first to confess feelings, etc.  Anywhere where others would tell you to be indifferent and short.\n\nWill this approach of saying how you genuinely feel work?  Ah, I don't know. That also depends on your definition of what works. Sometimes it will lead to satisfying deep relationships where a terse note wouldn't, but other times it would not. So it's not a magic \"I'm going to make him like me\" approach, but there's nothing like that anyway.\n\nThe point is that these notes are often for yourself, rather than for him. For you to know that you've exposed how you feel, that you've made things clear and now he can figure out of he wants a relationship or not. And that itself can make you feel better and can help you get out of ruminating about him (perhaps).\n\nIn any case, they are unlikely to hurt. Could he still ignore you and not respond? Of course. But that's the situation now anyways.  So it's no worse, but you needn't feel like there's some \"right\" way of responding that you don't know due to your inexperience. \n\nNow as to \"putting you on back burner\" -- that's the part I really don't get. What's the harm? Suppose he does that to you -- and then what?  It's one of those phrases that sounds like it's a bad thing, but when you think of it, there's nothing really bad to it. As long as you don't change _your_ behavior.  Meaning: continue chatting with other guys, going out on dates if you get any, continue moving on and living your life. Will he come back to bring you back from that \"back burner\"?  Who knows. But it doesn't matter, as long as you are not sitting around and waiting for him.  If he does come back, you can reevaluate then.\n\nSorry for this beast of a comment. There's nothing wrong with the text you did write. But just... Don't be afraid to be yourself. Just because lots of other people buy in to \"standard advice\", doesn't mean that they have some secret knowledge. And showing interest in other people very rarely hurts. Typically it helps, and helps a lot. Again, as long as you are not sitting around changing your life for one guy or bombarding him with love notes all the time. But expressing how you feel once? Why not. Let him be the one worrying about how to respond, while you breathe easier for having put your feelings in words."}

However, if the both of you are perfectly happy together, there’s no need to prepare yourself for any heartbreak. That’s not what love and relationships are about; these things can be scary because you’re not supposed to prepare yourself for anything. You’re supposed to be open, vulnerable, and accept the fact that anything is possible. \n\nSo basically what I’m saying is, have a conversation with her about how she’s feeling, and look into how you’re feeling too. I hope this helps :)"}

{"prompt":"My (30M) partner (31F) of 5 years keeps interrupting me while I'm working or doing chores, and I'm getting increasingly impatient. I need help sorting out my feelings and finding a way to open a kind, loving conversation about boundaries. (Throw away account since partner uses Reddit)\n\nFirst, to clear the air, I've been seriously in love with my partner. She's so comforting and understanding and kind. I never met anyone like her before. I often feel so understood by her, and things feel so easy.\n\nLately though, I've been getting annoyed with her, and very easily. We live separately, but will be hang out together during the workday (we both work from home) or just generally without plans. Whenever we hang out during the workday though, she constantly talks to me. She often talks about her work or her life and complains about things going on. I have a tough time concentrating, and so being interrupted can really derail my work flow (and work can can sometimes be stressful which makes the stress of resetting my concentration feel very intense). She also always asks me for hugs or to tell her when I'm ready for a break. These asks extend to the day in general: like, I'll be in the middle of cleaning up after dinner and she'll ask for a hug or if we can snuggle and clean up later. I feel like these asks are building up and beginning to annoy me more and more.\n\nThe thing that causes more resentment on my part is that I feel like I always respect her boundaries: I leave her alone when she needs to focus, let her clean things when they bother her, let her take time to send an email when we're snuggling. I don't understand why when I have to do things, or when she sees me doing things, she can't wait just a few minutes or find something to do for an hour or two while I wrap things up on a busy day.\n\nNow, for the difficult part: whenever I try to talk about how I get annoyed, she turns it back on me and says I'm a workaholic, or because I don't pay enough attention to her, or that my behavior makes her feel like I don't care about her enough. I feel like I invest an incredible amount of time and energy to make her comfortable and happy, but it never feels like enough. I invest time for dates, movie nights, and hang outs. We often hang out for entire weekends or evenings together, where I don't do anything but pay attention to her. I always answer frantic phone calls about stressful stuff at work. I always drop things (even work) to comfort her when she's feeling sick or stressed. But, when it comes to little things, if I say that I don't want to be bothered, then I'm heartless and not prioritizing her.\n\nShe feels as though she feels as though she tries so hard to respect my boundaries and that she's not asking for much and I'm just wrong for drawing the line where I do. And I don't think she's wrong (yes, a hug or question isn't much) but it's not just something that I can do when I'm in the middle of things--my ADHD brain just can't move from one task to the next easily, and it just causes me to get frustrated.\n\nI wish we could just be together, but in a way that lets me live some of my life on my terms, which, yes, means ignoring her a bit while I work or do chores. It doesn't mean I don't love her or acknowledge that I'm happy she's there, I just want to sweep a bit after cooking dinner! I just want to get things done so that I can finally relax, and fully pay attention to her.\n\nI've never met anyone like her, and don't have any desire to be with anyone else but her. But, I'm starting dread the idea of being needed all the time and worry about what that means about me and our relationship.\n\n**I want to open up a conversation about this, but I really don't know how to do it in a loving and kind way.** I also don't know how to frame the conversation in an impersonal way that doesn't make her feel bad (although I'm ranting in an accusatory way, it's about the situation not about her, it's about boundaries and communication). **Frankly, I don't know if my boundaries are fair or unfair and need to process my feelings and talk to others.** Still, I figured I'd post this rant while I process my feelings. Please share your thoughts!\n\n**TLDR**: My partner interrupts me a lot when I'm working or doing chores, and I'm getting increasingly annoyed. I don't know how to set a boundary, or whether a boundary is fair. I want to open a conversation about it, but can't figure out the way to do it.

{"prompt":"My [M30] GF [F30] says it's disrespectful she isn't invited to my best friend's wedding, I don't feel the same. **TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nI had a past where I struggled to say \"no,\" but now after a year of therapy and learning to set boundaries I'm starting to question myself if my actual judgment is compromised because of our toxic past.\n\nContext:\n\nGF has never liked the relationship I have with one of my best friends \\[F27\\] let's call her Luna, GF has no reason to hate Luna, she has never done anything to her but  she swears it's because I trust her so much (apparently you can only trust your GF) and because she has a \"bad vibe\" whatever that means, from the beginning of the relationship with GF Luna knew the situation and she came to me saying \"I know your girlfriend doesn't like me but now she is my best friend's girlfriend and I respect that decision, we are still friends\".\n\nIn 3 years of relationship, the first two years were a disaster, a very toxic and controlling environment from GF, GF wouldn't let me greet Luna or even send her a message on her birthday because it would be very hurtful for GF and I ended up giving her what she wanted, the problem is that in all that time I let those things continue to happen because it was difficult for me to say \"no\" (My bad there), never actually stood for my limits and boundaries and ended up distancing myself from Luna.\n\nA year ago I was at a breaking point because now the situation was not only against Luna, now it was also against other friends, my family, my time and my space. Everyone began to notice the change and as I moved away from all those people who were so important to me it began to eat me up from the inside and at that breaking point I decided to give ourselves some time.\n\nAt that time I started therapy and I felt that I needed my friends and ventilate myself, I went to Luna to kind of apologize and told her some things about what had happened with GF, she told me that regardless of what happened she was still my friend and for that reason she would respect the decisions I made, that made me cry because it felt very good that someone respected my will.\n\nLong story short, came back with GF, with the condition she also started going to therapy, we agreed that my limits would be respected, some time passed and now Luna is getting married in a few months, she sent me a wedding invitation for one person and I totally understood that decision, when I told GF about the situation, she got really upset because she says that it's disrespectful towards her and towards me that they do not invite a SO regardless of what happened.\n\nWe ended up fighting about the invitation to a wedding that she \"doesn't even want to go in the first place\" (quote from her) but because she wasn't invited now she wants me to ask for a +1 because if not I'm not giving her \"her place\" as my GF, the other option she is giving me is to not go to the wedding of my best friend that way she would also feel that I am giving her \"her place\" as my GF.\n\nShe told me her friends say that I'm wrong for not asking for an invitation for her because it's not about whether she wants to go or not, it's about the place that I give her as my girlfriend, and I'm confused as hell I think they don't have all the context in this situation and GF says I'm in defense mode for all the past but I'm just respecting Luna's decision.\n\n**TL;DR** GF never liked the relationship I have with my best friend, GF tried to distance me from her and other friends, we broke up, I told my best friend in a venting moment, came back to GF, now my best friend is getting married and she wants just me at the wedding that day, GF says that it is disrespectful towards me and towards her to not invite a SO regardless of the situation, I don't feel the same.","completion":"You're in an abusive relationship and your friends have been patiently waiting for you to see that, while making sure not to do anything to isolate you further.

Has she ever apologized?  To you, your family, your friends, Luna?\n\nSince, I assume your GF has been \"attempting\" to right the wrongs of your first 2 years, is her behavior/change significant enough for forgiveness?  Considering her response to not be invited I doubt it.\n\nYour GF has basically caused Luna to almost lose a friend, and treated her like crap for minimum 2 years.  Despite this;\n\n&gt;Luna knew the situation and she came to me saying \"I know your girlfriend doesn't like me but now she is my best friend's girlfriend and I respect that decision, we are still friends\".\n\nLuna is probably sick and tired of your GF treating her like garbage and ruining your life.  She's possibly also worried that your GF would cause problems at her wedding.  If your GF really understood the damage that she has caused then her reaction would've been one of understanding of not being invited, not what you got;\n\n&gt;We ended up fighting about the invitation to a wedding that she \"doesn't even want to go in the first place\" (quote from her) but because she wasn't invited now she wants me to ask for a +1 because if not I'm not giving her \"her place\" as my GF, the other option she is giving me is to not go to the wedding of my best friend that way she would also feel that I am giving her \"her place\" as my GF.\n\nThis is ridiculous, and her trying to use her \"friends\" as a way to manipulate you is more gaslighting and manipulation.  \"me and all these other people say you're wrong\".  \n\nI'm on Luna's side, I'd respect your terrible decision to allow yourself to be with this toxic person, but I will never let her sabotage my own life for you, let alone my own wedding."}

{"prompt":"My wife (32F) &amp; I (30M) are having issues with our sex life, should I be worried? First off, I apologize for improper punctuation and sentence structure, thanks for reading and keeping that in mind.\n\n**TLDR**: My wife and I haven't had sex in over 3 years. We used to have sex (not much) before we got married and now it's literally impossible to convince her to do it. Her typical reasonings are \"I'm tired\" or just blatantly ignores the advance. When we did have sex (a handful of times...) it was always a chore... and never ended with any good orgasm. She usually said \"it hurts\" or \"ow\". Mind you I was NOT going hard or fast or anything. It's like trying to move a mountain getting her aroused (impossible) no matter what I did she wouldn't get wet. What should I do?\n\n So a little background on me before I met my wife; I was an extremely sexual active guy, with all of my past relationships I would have sex at least 5-10 times a week. All of my partners would have no problem with it, they to were just as engaged with the sexual advances as I was. I'm not some sort of supermodel, extremely yoked, rich guy either. I am of average looks, tattooed out the wazoo (minus hands and above the neck), I don't have a massive **shlong** (above average), middle class dude. I was worldly, as in traveled all over before I moved to Japan to live, where I met my wife after a year of living there.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 7 years now, married for 5. I am American, she is Japanese. Our first year together (living in Japan), it was awesome, traveled a lot, experienced so many things together and were practically happy all the time. Mind you, we did have our typical \"couple arguments\", but it always was resolved and we moved on fine. Now throughout our first year of being together we didn't rush into having sexual relations. It started off as business and client, then to friends, finally to dating. We didn't have sex for the first 6 months. Then we ventured into progressing our relationship further.\n\nI will say that our first time having sex was normal, she got aroused just fine and was just as into as I was. The relationship grew closer of course, so about a year later I asked her to marry me, she said \"of course\". Sex life was still present, but I started to notice things like she would say \"ow\" a lot, so I would be very slow and conscious of my actions, regardless it would always be \"Ow\". I thought it wasn't a big deal maybe it's just because we were doing it too much or what-have-you.  \n\nFast forward to getting married, I had to move to the States due to my business expanding and family (stateside) tragedies. So, we discuss this she decided she will move with me and quit her very successful career in business district Tokyo. We begin the process of applying for a green card. I move stateside and buy a house and continue working on the business and immigrations. 2 years into our marriage she finally gets her visa. She moves all her earthly possessions to America to be with me. During our extended period apart we would facetime everyday multiple times a day and \"sext\" or \"facetime sext\" (? I don't know how to explain this part haha) so we were excited to finally get to have sex again. Anyways, we finally get down  to it, mind you I did not rush into this it was like a week or two before I suggested the idea, she agreed. That was the last time we actually had what I would consider sex, and it wasn't fulfilling at all for either of us.. she had a very hard time getting aroused, and no matter what I did as soon as I touched her down below she would say \"ow\". So since that was what happened she then offered to just give me blow jobs or just let me masturbate with her naked or whatever. I made due, I had a ever growing sexual drive that just couldn't be satiated. \n\nNow, fast forward to current time line, we haven't had successful sex since then. Sure there were intermittent times when she would blow me, or I would just rub one out. But now I'm a bundle of pent up sexual stress and have been having **adulterous thoughts, borderline porn addiction, putting blame on her for \"underperforming\" (** I understand that's not okay trust me I feel bad, I just get so frustrated I feel like I'm to blame). So, recently I have noticed within the past few months whenever we are sleeping and I go to hold her boobies her **nipples will be hard, but as soon as I put my hand on her boobs, they go soft**... I have also noticed that **NO MATTER WHAT I DO TO GET HER AROUSED SHE'S DRIER THAN THE DESERT AND WILL NOT GET WET. Whenever I suggest we try to have sex, she gets an upset stomach and actually has diarrhea.**  \n\nAnd NOTE: She has shown no other signs of her cheating on me, she has a full greencard (she refuses to get American citizenship when asked about it), still hasn't left me even when I was at my lowest point in life and tried to divorce her she refused, and even after I've had 2 strokes and 5 heart surgeries she still takes care of me and shows an extraordinary amount of love for me except when it comes to sex.\n\nSO here are my questions:\n\n* What do I do to help her become aroused again?\n* Why does her nipples go soft after I touch her boobs?\n* Why does she say \"Ow\" whenever I try touching her vagina?\n* Should I be worried?\n* Is there something wrong with me?","completion":"Has she seen a doctor?"}

Pretty much 99% of people do it so you'd be hard pressed to find anyone, man or woman, who doesn't do it although it's worth mentioning that that alone doesn't mean you should accept something just because someone else has deemed it acceptable.\n\nMasterbating is far more than sexual desire. It's a healthy, normal way of releasing stress and improving relaxation. I think you make too strong of a connection between him jerking off with feeling sexual desire outside of your relationship when this is often not the case. \nYou should value yourself more than a sexual object for your partner to rely on for sexual gratification. I'd say it's a good thing he doesn't do that seeing as he masturbates but is still able to have a sexual relationship with you."}

Let me give you an example: an abusive partner is seeing who they are and agreeing to go to counseling to change. The person they abused can BOTH support that person in changing as well as ensure their peace is protected by advocating for themselves. You are right that change doesn't occur overnight, but it is the responsibility of NO ONE to endure abuse while someone is learning to change. You can both say I love you and I love me. I want you to be healthy, but I will not subject myself to abuse waiting for you to get healthy. Staying just enables an abusive person to keep being abusive. Just because someone is changing or maybe you can understand why they behave the way they do given their past upbringing or traumatic event, doesn't mean any other person should stay to be their punching bag emotionally or physically until they're \"better\". You can love someone and walk away (temporarily or permanently) from unsafe or enabling circumstances to protect yourself at the same time."}

Not everyone has the energy to full out have sex every time they’re in the mood, and sometimes it’s just nice to have a moment like that to yourself.

After about a year she had managed to come between us to the point that my best friend cut me off completely. \n\n3 years later, my best friend reaches out. He drove to my house in the middle of the night and told me the whole story - after she cut me out, she isolated him more and more. Then once he felt alone enough, she started disrespecting him and their relationship. \n\nYou’ve seen the beginning of this story already, she is isolating you from your loved ones. This is classic abuser behaviour - she will make it seem like all you should need to be happy is her, and then once your happiness hinges on her, she is in control. \n\nLuna sounds like a great friend for being willing to step aside and put your happiness and relationship before her own feelings and friendship with you. But if I could go back to the beginning, I would do everything in my power to stop it from getting there because the friend the I got back when that relationship ended was badly, badly hurt and affected by what she put him through. \n\nThis may be way longer, or dramatic than you want to hear - but I know your story, and I know where it will go if you don’t end it."}

{"prompt":"Is it fair for me (36M) to ask my bride (36F) to pay more for our wedding if she makes more than me and her guestlist is much longer than mine? My bride and I have similar, but somewhat uneven income. We work equally as hard, but thanks to her career stage, she makes about 25% more than I do. Not a major difference, and we split 50% of all of our life costs (mortgage, food, utilities, car maintenance, travel, restaurants etc.) since our income are close enough that we can both live comfortably. The only difference is that she has more money than I do at the end of the month for personal investments. Fair enough. \n\nBut now we're planning our wedding. We're trying to keep it under budget, and I was hoping for it to be around $10k, but now that we've done our research, it's more likely going to be around $17k. I'm venturing into uncomfortable territory. I know that it's common to expect wedding gifts, but I don't want to assume I'll be getting any gifts, and certainly nowhere close to half of the wedding costs. I'm certainly not expecting financial help from my family as they already helped me purchase my first home.\n\nAs usual, my bride wants us to split the costs 50%-50%, as we do for all other wedding costs. Here comes the tricky part. We're aiming for a \"small\" wedding,  and about 70% of the costs are due to the venue's fees for 40 guests - but about 30 of those 40 guests are hers, and only about 10 are mine. I have an extremely small family and very few close friends that I would bother inviting - while she has a much larger family and several childhood friends she wants to to invite.\n\nI don't want to ask her to cut out two-thirds of her guests, since I'd agree with her that most of her guests are more meaningful than my own. So I don't want to block them from coming. At the same time, if it as just up to me, I wouldn't have invited them just because of how expensive it is per additional guest. I want things to be fair for both of us from both a financial and emotional perspective. \n\nWould it be fair to ask that she pays her share of the venue fees in proportion to her guestlist? Or at least pay 25% more for the wedding costs in proportion to her income? Or do you have other advice?\n\nThank you!","completion":"Finances are one of the top things people divorce over. Having this conversation now - learning to do it and making sure it goes well - is one of the best things you can do to make sure you have a long marriage. Consider premarital counseling if you haven’t but generally - be honest with her. You don’t have enough available funds to split this evenly so you need her help or you need it cheaper. \n\nAlso, reconsider splitting 50/50 when one person makes far more.\n\nEdit because I just have to say… $17k for a 40 person wedding is WILDLY expensive."}

It seems like you know this person is bad for you, so I'm confused as to why you are putting yourself at her mercy? You have the choice. Block her, if she does attempt other forms of contact, you say no and ignore her. The person she is being is the person she is right now, and you can't accept that version of her. Never date for potential, never hope someone will change for you. It is almost always unlikely. Its time to let go of this one and work on why you accepted such poor treatment.

He told me that I always look for something to be upset about before he goes on a trip (which he does tomorrow). I told him that this has zero to do with his trip and 100% to do with the last 2 days. \n\nHe then put his headphones on and ignored me. I am trying to figure out if I am overreacting, because he always tells me my work is great and needs to be hung up around the house, that I do professional style work, that he wants to get good frames for my photos, etc. but it feels like when something *actually* big happened, it wasnt treated as such.","completion":"How does an 18 year old have dozens of relationships under her belt?"}
{"prompt":"I (F19) don't know how to feel about my LD relationship with (F24) Does this count as a relationship?\n\nHello!! I'm currently 19 (F) and I'm a lesbian. I've never been a relationship before and don't have any romantic experience whatsoever. \nHalf a year ago, I started messaging someone on reddit, a women whos 24. We quickly switched to messaging each other on WhatsApp and we've talked almost every day for the past 6 months. \nA month ago, we confessed that we both like each other. The relationship is long distance, I'm in England and she is in Norway, but she has said that she has family in England and has visited and stayed for holidays before. \n\nI guess, because I've never been in a relationship and all the ones I've seen, watched or read about include physical contact like hugs and stuff, a part of me feels like this isn't a \"real\" realtionship. But then I was thinking about it more thoroughly and was wondering if I'd still feel like this if this was a boy I was in a LD relationship with? Maybe it's internalised homophobia?\n\nAnother thing is, I'm extremely introverted and don't have any friends. I talk occasionally to my coworkers. One coworker mentioned it was weird that I was 19 and she was 5, almost 6 years, older than me. I never thought it was weird because the age difference never affected any of our conversations but my coworker just thought it was weird with the age difference, combined with the fact that we met online. \n\nSo I guess I'm looking for any advice? Or opinions? \nThank you!","completion":"It’s only a problem, because you’re making it one.  I’m not trying to be mean here, so I apologize for coming off as such as it’s genuinely not my intention, but conflict is absolutely not inherently healthy in a relationship and you’re in no position to decide that’s the case. \n\nAnecdotally, I’m a guy and I’m happily married. I assure you that my wife and I have dealt with conflict, and handled it accordingly. \n\nBut you’re not the only person who has this idea. The concern that healthy relationships must have conflict and they must have fights.  No, they don’t. Context is everything, but with no context, it’s absolutely not inherently a good thing to have conflict or fight. \n\nIt’s one thing if conflict doesn’t happen because one or both partners are aware of incompatibilities or issues and just avoid them, but the problem isn’t that they don’t fight; it’s that they refuse to acknowledge reality.\n\nSo your thought process is a mistake. If conflict doesn’t exist, creating it is absolutely insane. If “something’s missing,” it’s because you’re incompatible not that they want to fight. \n\nThis sounds silly because it is silly. The genuine problem is you thinking your premise is correct. If you’re happy and in healthy relationships, conflict isn’t what reignites a spark if you’ve lost it. Talking to each other, working together and reminding each other why you had a spark to begin with is how you do it."}

I don't even think it has to be based on \"health\", it can be based on attraction as well/instead. The main points are that you have the conversation ONE time, you don't act like you know her body better, and you aren't condescending as if she doesn't know she has gained weight. \n\nI think you just tell her- you had surgery recently, you have had X, Y, Z, and yes, you have gained weight. I am worried about you, and I want to support you. How can I do that?\n\nLet her answer. If she says she wants help but it's clear she kind of doesn't know what to do, then you carry on the conversation, letting her lead. Does she want to go for walks together, cook healthy together, join a gym, get a trainer. When you try any of those things with her, or she tries them on her own, gentle encouragement and realize she will try and fail at many diets/regimes, and that you don't get to be her boss about it. Give her space, time, and support. I tried like 50 times to lose weight before one stuck, and I will always struggle with my weight. \n\nIf she gets mad, just end the conversation and try again later. \"I know this is hard, but it is something we need to deal with. I want a long life with you, and this is getting unhealthy.\" If she thinks she is fine, press the issue a little bit. And in both these cases, realize that once you have said it, that's the end of it. Give her a little space and time, and then decide what you want to do- do you want to tell her flat out you aren't attracted to her anymore and want a divorce, or because she isn't taking care of herself you want out? That is totally fine by the way! \n\nThe only time it isn't fine is when people harp on someone about their weight or act like they don't realize they are fat (we do know, it just isn't something we can fix easily), or act like you can save them. All you can do is convey your thoughts clearly and with respect one time, and then take her actions to decide your next steps, just like with any other relationship issue."}

{"prompt":"30M dumped by 31F, very suddenly and unexpected 10 months dating\n7 months in a relationship\n\nVery few arguments, only real disagreement was on number of phone calls from me to her, which I had to up my numbers as she wasn't feeling cared about. I did this and things seemed good. Important info: twice whilst stressed she made noises around stopping dating/breaking up, early in the relationship. Since then she's been stress free until recently where she's looking for a part time job to no avail whilst studying deadlines are mounting up. We spoke on the phone with her saying she doesn't see any point in carrying on as our energy doesn't match at the moment and things don't feel right. This is immediately after she had a week break spent at mine, laughing joking staying up late and just generally being a \"perfect couple\". No arguments just great fun. \n\nI sent a heartfelt long text telling her how much I cared, what I was trying to do for her and how I had her back, and was it the stress talking. I received this in response.\n\n: You didn't do anything wrong. Sorry for all the caused pain. \nThe problem is-  I have no energy and resources to maintain a relationship atm. You can't make someone happy when you are not fine yourself.\n: I wish I felt differently\n: I know you did your best. Letting someone go when you cant make them happy is a way of showing love as well as staying and making them happy. You will feel more demotivated with every day if we stay together.\n: Just let it go. It is sad it hurts but the longer we stay together the harder will get.\n\n\nAlso to note she's quite the straight talker so if there was something really bothering her she wouldn't pull punches. It feels a bit of a weak reason? I don't really understand the energy or resources to maintain relationship? It naturally flows? doesn't need maintenence?","completion":"You fundamentally cannot let go because your sense of happiness is tied to his acceptance of you. He didn't \"psuedo\" ghost you - he's actively ghosting you and you have such a low self opinion of yourself that you're willing to debase yourself and still try to come after him. I can't speak to his motivations for ghosting you, but saying \"you had a chance\" and that you \"ruined it\" seems like the coward's way of ending the relationship (as all ghosting is) without admitting his faults or other interests.\n\nEither way, continuing to pursue him is toxic and you are better than NEEDING someone. Have some self respect and close this chapter of your life. Also, take some time for self improvement, self care, and simply move on with your life before you do something actually illegal or disappoint yourself further with chasing this dead end."}
{"prompt":"Should I [f21] tell my boyfriend [m22] about what happened 3 years ago? My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. I’ve never loved someone as much as I’ve loved this man. He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7-8 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I knew that I wanted to break it off for him for a little while and kept pushing it off. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality and a million other things at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. I wasn’t seeking a relationship nor really anything else. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I don’t remember what our original conversation was about. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. I feel like if I don’t tell him how, then I’m lying to him or that if I brought it up one day he’ll think it’s worse than what it was or maybe even that I hide things from him. I had honest to god forgotten about this event because I I really didn’t like her and it was just some stupid attention thing. Someone brought up her name last month and now I literally can’t stop thinking about it. I go to bed thinking about it, I wake up thinking about, I’ve cried thinking about it.\n\nMy therapist said that this sounds like a normal teenage thing to do and that I need to learn to control my obsessive thoughts but I feel like this is different. I feel like if I don’t tell him then I’m keeping it a secret. We’ve been dating now for 4 years and I feel like I owe him the honesty. Everyone else has told me to move past it, and that telling him would just hurt his feelings and maybe even make him question me for still thinking about it 4 years later.\n\nDo I tell him for honesty sake or do I keep it to myself? Should I feel as shitty as I do or was this just a mistake in my past? Everyone is telling me the opposite of what my brain is feeling. Maybe this is just karma for being such a shitty girl friend in the beginning.","completion":"\\&gt;&gt;he thinks victim blaming is funny\n\nSo he's a POS then?"}

{"prompt":"Should I [f21] tell my boyfriend [m22] about what happened 3 years ago? My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. I’ve never loved someone as much as I’ve loved this man. He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7-8 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I knew that I wanted to break it off for him for a little while and kept pushing it off. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality and a million other things at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. I wasn’t seeking a relationship nor really anything else. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I don’t remember what our original conversation was about. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. I feel like if I don’t tell him how, then I’m lying to him or that if I brought it up one day he’ll think it’s worse than what it was or maybe even that I hide things from him.

I (F25) think I'm in a casual relationship but he (M32) confuses me and won't talk about it. What do I do? Help me, I'm losing it.\n\nTwo months ago, I went on a date with a guy I see almost everyday. We work close to each other.  We've met for Netflix and chill 3 more times \n\nWe went on a walk, early afternoon (he insisted on that) , walked for 5 hours talking, we had dinner afterwards, took me home and... things escalated quickly, we had sex (I initiated it, it 100% wouldn't happen otherwise). He said a lot of shit about us being in a relationship in the future (fucking weird ik, first date ). I told him that I don't want anyone to know shit in my workplace and we agreed on being extremely secretive no matter what. \n\nFrom what I know, he has a bad reputation, he stays with a girl for less than a month and then dissappears. Knowing that, I can't trust his ass so I expect nothing, I'M MORE THAN FINE with a casual relationship . My friends say I'm stupid that I can't see that he wants more than a casual relationship , I just turn him down too much. Some said that I'll be the one hurting him so I have to walk away. I believe he's just PLAYING because he's a player. Also most of the things he says don't make sense. \nThe signs:\n - First of all, I'm the only girl he went on an actual date, for a walk in 5 years. He also has asked on multiple occasions if I talk to other people just to see where this is going. \n- I told him I don't trust him so I can't be trusted either, I have a bad reputation of ghosting and I can easily dissappear. He was really offended, but at last he agreed that he can't be trusted. He also said that he never asked me to be trustworthy but saying that I'm not isn't ok. \n-He never fucking gets out of his house , he has an extreme schedule and follows it to the T. Works a lot and does the same 3 things all week. I'm an addition to his schedule, I can bend it somehow , he will say yes no matter the day. He picks me up and we talk and watch a movie, sex, finishing the movie and gossip for 3 hours. It's a five hour interaction every time. He is extremely cute, does the absolute most to take care of me, kisses me a lot, hugs me more. He cuddles with me. He said he hasn't slept with another person in years, he doesn't cuddle, he said . He cuddles with me, won't let me leave in the morning because he wants me to stay a little longer .He got our of bed and RUN to me just to kiss me before I left in the morning, he fucking complained that I didn't kiss him goodbye before leaving . He won't initiate dates though, it's always a \"come to my place to watch a movie \" 🚩. \n- I have ghosted him, on multiple occasions, not on purpose, I'm the worst texter. He won't care, he will double text, goodmorning texts every day. He takes like 5 hours to answer too though.Unless the conversation is about tea or sex. To me that's a clear sign of a man that isn't that interested🚩. \n - Last week he complained that I never ask if he's ok, I never did even when I knew he was sick, I only care about his dick he said. I answered \"true\".For now caring about him is the wrong thing to do. No matter how many times I've tried to sneakily ask about us he fucking avoids it saying \"it doesn't matter what I want\", \"doesn't matter what I say\". 🚩\n- I told him that our thing isn't serious and he fucking asked if \"I blame him for that too\". What does this even mean.... \nI didn't reply for two days, he texted first again but now he's weirdly cocky, replies less. Pisses me off honestly and I don't know if it's my fault or he's losing interest. \n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like a man that wants more than a casual relationship, would do something about it . Are those signs that he wants more than a sex only relationship or is everyone delusional but me?","completion":"You really don’t think so?

We were laughing with each other and the teacher was basically telling us to be quiet multiple times 🤷‍♂️. Anyway I didn’t have my phone on me and didn’t ask for her number (stupidly). She’s always the first one out of class cause she’s by the door and I can never seem to catch up with her to ask her to hang out or for her number. So I went home and requested to follow her Instagram (we gave each other our names in class so I already knew it). She didn’t accept or reject it for a day, so I just unrequested so I didn’t come off as weird. Did I screw up here? Was it too soon? I just got out of a long relationship and haven’t had to think about these things for a while. If I did screw up I’d love some honest advice about how I could fix the situation. I’m not obsessing over being with this girl, I’d rather just get to know her first, but I’m worried I came off too strong.","completion":"If it doesn’t work with her, or she wants to be friends, he’s about to lose his friend. I say let Mike calm down and think about it, he’s autistic so communication isn’t his strong point. Be the bigger man, communicate with Mike after he’s cooled down and try to work things out. I’ve had friends say some pretty fucked up things to me and I’ve said them back, we’ve apologized to each other after a few days and went right back to how we were, kick it and throwing beers back again. Ngl for me it’s easier to get laid than it is to make a best friend that I trust. We’re human and we all have our moments, don’t let that be the deciding factor on where me move in our lives, if he still continues to have this moment and lash out at you, then move on and let him figure himself out and do you. Be the bigger man. Pride kills the strongest of man."}
{"prompt":"New gf (26f) making me (27m) miss my ex.. I’m not sure how else to say this, but I started dating this new girl and she made me think about the good things my ex (dated for 3.5 years) did for me. When my ex and I broke up I remember I wasn’t feeling happy in the relationship, but this new one is making me see my light under golden light.\n\nMy ex wasn’t jealous, possessive, or aggressive. This new girl would always threaten to come to my house and break my windows if I ever talked to a new girl, call me outta nowhere to make sure I’m not ignoring her when I’m sleeping, always ask for more signs of affection (literally rotated around the love languages and asked me to show more of one, then later gave me her top 3 love languages), has crazy debt and relied on me to guide her through life situations giving her anxiety, wanted me to be a caretaker and her emotional regulator… but at the same time she’d be willing to give me anything I asked her for. Why is it that her love doesn’t touch me anymore and I’m just thinking about an ex who I don’t think is even compatible with me?","completion":"Ok. Time to dump the girl.

{"prompt":"My (19F) family, doesn’t like my boyfriend (19M) even though they’ve never met him. M\n\nFor context, I (19 F) have been dating a guy (19 M) for about 6 months now. I haven’t told my family yet because I don’t know how they’d react, but I was planning to tell them on Valentine’s Day. \n\nInto the real story here. \n\nMy family doesn’t know I’m dating him, and yet somehow they’ve formed an opinion on him solely based on his outward appearance and the few conversations they’ve had together, in which he’s always been very nice and polite. \n\nHe’s on the heavier side, and I know my family isn’t a fan of that. I personally don’t care. He’s never been a bad sport about his weight, always cracking jokes about it and doesn’t let it hold him back, and he’s actively trying to lose weight, so I can look past that. \n\nI really do like him, and I just wished my family wasn’t so quick to judge someone they’ve never actually met. Every time they’ve interacted it’s because he’s been helping me, usually to carry heavy things to and from my moms car. He’s incredibly helpful. \n\nI’m certain the only reason they don’t like him, is one, because he’s on the darker side (we’re not white but somehow my family is still very racist) and two, because he’s a heavier guy (which I feel isn’t fair because no one in my family is exactly small or skinny themselves). \n\nI don’t really know what to do because I know if I introduce him to my family they’re going to tell me not to be with him or that they don’t like him, and there’s really not much I can do to change their mind. But if I don’t introduce him to them, it’ll just end badly because they’ll likely find out eventually considering his family already knows we’re dating. (Side note, they don’t really like me either. It’s another racism related thing along with some other personal stuff) \n\nWhat should I do?","completion":"One, google defensiveness in relationships. Defensiveness is often found when someone is insecure, it can get confused with narcissism (as narcs are often defensive) and defensiveness is way more common than narcissism.\n\nAs for the relationship, the age difference, her demanding more and giving so little, the possible defensiveness or narcissism, no one would fault you for getting a divorce. Maybe before that get some therapy for yourself to help you better unpack what’s going on and how you feel about it. From there you’ll be better able to decide if it’s worth trying to fix or if it’s best to call it quits."}

{"prompt":"M40 and F36 - Whenever we argue, she needs closeness to resolve the tension, and I need distance. Can this be reconciled? **TL;DR - recurring and seemingly irreconcilable conflict in an otherwise good relationship with plenty of good times.** Sorry if this post is too long.\n\nI am a 40 year old man, my partner is a 36 year old woman. I am currently unemployed, usually work in low level admin, and she is in management (we've never worked together). Neither of us have an issue with our earnings disparity. We've been together two years, live 100 miles apart, spend our weekends together at either place.\n\nWe were at her place today and she told me she would be going out for an hour, but didn't tell me why and I didn't ask. She had some time before her friend arrived to pick her up. She took off her makeup and we played video games together.\n\nHer friend texted her on arrival and my gf got up to leave. I told her I'd play online while she was out, and plugged in my headphones. I was in the online lobby when I heard her call out from the other room: \"I'll take that as a no.\" I took the headphones out and asked her what she had said. She said it didn't matter. I could tell she was annoyed, so I asked again. She said she had asked if I wanted a drink or snack before she left. I said I was sorry I can't hear much with headphones in. I said no thank you to the offer and she left.\n\nWhen she came back, she had her makeup bag with her and I saw that she was made up again. I expressed surprise that she took off her makeup only to put it back on again. She said that her friend had done it as a practice run, because we are going to a party in a few weeks and her friend is going to do her makeup then.\n\nWe went in to the kitchen to make dinner, and I sat at the table to type something on my laptop - not an essay, just a quick thought I had about a project I'm working on. She said something to me while I was typing a sentence, and as I finished it I looked up to ask what she said. She said it didn't matter and she wasn't going to compete with a computer for my attention. I stood up and asked her to please tell me because I cannot do two things at once. If my mind is on a task, I cannot process other things, even if I recognise that something has been said.\n\nShe was upset that she got made up specially for me and I didn't even notice. I told her that I noticed she had makeup on again and she looked good. I just didn't see any difference to how she looked earlier in the day before she took her makeup off, and I didn't understand why she had done that.\n\nI could tell that she was hurt by this and I felt shitty about it. When this sort of conflict occurs I feel like I am in a minefield and I'd rather keep silent than put a foot wrong and make things worse - sort of like that old saying, \"better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt\". I strive to be always honest, but I know it can upset people when I am.\n\nUnfortunately this escalated things because she kept asking me to communicate with her and I didn't know what to say. She said she wanted my attention, and I felt like I was giving it to her wholeheartedly, but because I was silent she just said \"Nothing?\" and turned and left the room. This seems to happen every time we argue.\n\nEventually we agreed to make dinner and watch TV to try and move on, but as we were making dinner she kept asking me questions, like \"Do you think we should do the veg at the same time as the chicken, or afterwards?\", \"Do you think the chicken is done yet?\", \"Should we use the rest of the seasoning, or is that enough?\"\n\nI can feed myself well enough, but I know next to nothing about cooking and she is practically an expert in comparison, so I always defer to her in the kitchen. For each question, I said \"I have no idea.\" This infuriated her more, but she seemed to calm down when I told her that she is better qualified to make those calls.\n\n(Sometimes she asks me questions then disregards what I say. While we were shopping earlier, she asked me what seasoning we should get, and I picked the spicy one. She said it was too spicy for her, so we got the mild one instead. I asked, \"why didn't you just pick the one you wanted instead of asking me and then shooting me down?\" This upset her.)\n\nWe were eating and watching our show. I was still uncomfortable, and I could tell she was too. We finished eating and she apologised \"for being hard work\", and I said I was sorry for contributing to it. She said when she is feeling anxious, she needs physical affection to reassure her. The trouble is, I want the opposite in these situations; I don't feel sexy or affectionate at all, just awkward with a need to be alone. She asked if I would give her a hug so I opened my arm for her to lean in, which she did while we watched the end of the show.\n\nAfter the show, she said she was going to bed. I decided to stay up for a while. She wasn't happy about this, and said again that she needs some affection to feel better after our argument. I told her that I need some space to recover.\n\nThe conversation escalated again, and it felt like she was demanding I ignore my own needs in favour of hers. I hate going over the same ground repeatedly in these conversations, and asked her to please just drop it because I couldn't see a resolution. She said she just wanted things to be normal again, and I asked why then did she persist in recapitulating the argument which wasn't getting us anywhere? This did not help. I was frustrated that I could not get through to her that I needed some space, so I decided to pack my things and go home. It took a minute to gather my stuff, with her screaming at me not to abandon her as I left.\n\nThat sounds pretty awful, but we have a good relationship for the most part.

{"prompt":"M40 and F36 - Whenever we argue, she needs closeness to resolve the tension, and I need distance. Can this be reconciled? **TL;DR - recurring and seemingly irreconcilable conflict in an otherwise good relationship with plenty of good times.** Sorry if this post is too long.\n\nI am a 40 year old man, my partner is a 36 year old woman. I am currently unemployed, usually work in low level admin, and she is in management (we've never worked together). Neither of us have an issue with our earnings disparity. We've been together two years, live 100 miles apart, spend our weekends together at either place.\n\nWe were at her place today and she told me she would be going out for an hour, but didn't tell me why and I didn't ask. She had some time before her friend arrived to pick her up. She took off her makeup and we played video games together.\n\nHer friend texted her on arrival and my gf got up to leave. I told her I'd play online while she was out, and plugged in my headphones. I was in the online lobby when I heard her call out from the other room: \"I'll take that as a no.\" I took the headphones out and asked her what she had said. She said it didn't matter. I could tell she was annoyed, so I asked again. She said she had asked if I wanted a drink or snack before she left. I said I was sorry I can't hear much with headphones in. I said no thank you to the offer and she left.\n\nWhen she came back, she had her makeup bag with her and I saw that she was made up again. I expressed surprise that she took off her makeup only to put it back on again. She said that her friend had done it as a practice run, because we are going to a party in a few weeks and her friend is going to do her makeup then.\n\nWe went in to the kitchen to make dinner, and I sat at the table to type something on my laptop - not an essay, just a quick thought I had about a project I'm working on. She said something to me while I was typing a sentence, and as I finished it I looked up to ask what she said. She said it didn't matter and she wasn't going to compete with a computer for my attention. I stood up and asked her to please tell me because I cannot do two things at once. If my mind is on a task, I cannot process other things, even if I recognise that something has been said.\n\nShe was upset that she got made up specially for me and I didn't even notice. I told her that I noticed she had makeup on again and she looked good. I just didn't see any difference to how she looked earlier in the day before she took her makeup off, and I didn't understand why she had done that.\n\nI could tell that she was hurt by this and I felt shitty about it. When this sort of conflict occurs I feel like I am in a minefield and I'd rather keep silent than put a foot wrong and make things worse - sort of like that old saying, \"better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt\". I strive to be always honest, but I know it can upset people when I am.\n\nUnfortunately this escalated things because she kept asking me to communicate with her and I didn't know what to say. She said she wanted my attention, and I felt like I was giving it to her wholeheartedly, but because I was silent she just said \"Nothing?\" and turned and left the room. This seems to happen every time we argue.\n\nEventually we agreed to make dinner and watch TV to try and move on, but as we were making dinner she kept asking me questions, like \"Do you think we should do the veg at the same time as the chicken, or afterwards?\", \"Do you think the chicken is done yet?\", \"Should we use the rest of the seasoning, or is that enough?\"\n\nI can feed myself well enough, but I know next to nothing about cooking and she is practically an expert in comparison, so I always defer to her in the kitchen. For each question, I said \"I have no idea.\" This infuriated her more, but she seemed to calm down when I told her that she is better qualified to make those calls.\n\n(Sometimes she asks me questions then disregards what I say. While we were shopping earlier, she asked me what seasoning we should get, and I picked the spicy one. She said it was too spicy for her, so we got the mild one instead. I asked, \"why didn't you just pick the one you wanted instead of asking me and then shooting me down?\" This upset her.)\n\nWe were eating and watching our show. I was still uncomfortable, and I could tell she was too. We finished eating and she apologised \"for being hard work\", and I said I was sorry for contributing to it. She said when she is feeling anxious, she needs physical affection to reassure her. The trouble is, I want the opposite in these situations; I don't feel sexy or affectionate at all, just awkward with a need to be alone. She asked if I would give her a hug so I opened my arm for her to lean in, which she did while we watched the end of the show.\n\nAfter the show, she said she was going to bed. I decided to stay up for a while. She wasn't happy about this, and said again that she needs some affection to feel better after our argument. I told her that I need some space to recover.\n\nThe conversation escalated again, and it felt like she was demanding I ignore my own needs in favour of hers. I hate going over the same ground repeatedly in these conversations, and asked her to please just drop it because I couldn't see a resolution. She said she just wanted things to be normal again, and I asked why then did she persist in recapitulating the argument which wasn't getting us anywhere? This did not help. I was frustrated that I could not get through to her that I needed some space, so I decided to pack my things and go home. It took a minute to gather my stuff, with her screaming at me not to abandon her as I left.\n\nThat sounds pretty awful, but we have a good relationship for the most part.

The way I grieve seem to be very similar to your husband, I rarely cry and not really something I like to do infront of others. I keep myself busy, so I don't have to constantly think about the thing that's causing the grief and I am then able to process it in a slower bit for bit way that's healthy for me. It's hard for me to just sit still and feel miserable and I would rather use those emotions productively.\n\nNow that doesn't really mean I don't cater to the emotional needs of those around me grieving and I think your husband is doing that. He is trying to stay strong for you and himself, to show that as awful and heartbreaking the loss is, there is hope in the future and that he feels he needs to hold it together, because he feels someone needs to. I do understand that's not what you want to hear from him in the moment, but I think that adds some perspective to his actions \n\nI certainly understand where all your feelings and concerns are coming from, but I think you need to understand you can't tell him how to grieve, you can tell him how he can supportive of you in this time and how you likely wise can also be supportive of him.

Find someone who truly cares about you and your well being and who will put in the work to make a real relationship. You aren't too much, that man just cares about sex and nothing else. You deserve better, FWB only works if both are detached. I'm sorry that whatever happened to you happened but you need to find someone who's worthy of your love because this isn't it. Good luck, and I hope you find peace. A good place to start is therapy, specifically if it's sexual intimacy or S/A that is your \"torture\" (to use his words).

Since then she was constantly pushing through topic of living together. To be clear I really wanted to live with her but since I started collage everything my life started falling apart and I was diagnosed with depression. I was stressed with my collage, my parents company which started to go bankrupt and my father’s mental health. He developed depression and had suicidal thoughts. I was stressed by everything that was happening in my live and I didn’t want to tell anyone about it even my dearest girlfriend. I started collapsing and close myself for others. During time I was alone I was smoking marihuana to stop thinking about everything and be happy. I started getting annoyed with every text from her and really thought about ending this relationship. But every time that we met I couldn’t push myself to do it. She cared for me and loved me with all her heart. She is smart so she noticed that sth was bothering me but I never told her. I didn’t want to tell anyone. 3 months ago she decided to go to a club with her friend (20 F) and had some fun. Nothing serious just she spent a night with her but I didn’t know that at that time. When I found out ( the next day) in a state of rage at her I went out with my friend (20 F) that she was jealous. Nothing serious I just wanted to talk with her and I told her (my gf) many times that she is only my friend. She (friend) told her that too. We were meeting like once a month or two, for few hours so it wasn’t a big deal for me, but I wanted to make her jealous. I know it was stupid but that’s what I did. During meeting I wrote to my gf that I met up with her because I felt guilty. After that she stopped replying to my texts and after 2 days with no contact she broke up with me and blocked me on every social media. I tried to give her space but I really missed her and after a week I drove 1000 km in hope to see her during her championship. I wanted to tell her how much I care and love her. Unfortunately she stayed in her hotel room refusing to talk to me. So I came back home. Since then I tried many times contacting with her and her family and every time that I asked I got the answers like “if you really care for her give her time” or “I’m can’t tell you yet what I feel to you”. When I met her like month ago I told her everything I struggled with and asked her if she wants me to fight for our relationship or no. she told me that she can’t tell me that yet.

Liek trash/recycling, which get picked up on certain days. But even then, it's not always the end of the world if it gets forgotten one week.

It happens to be that almost every time that I think about wanting to make plans, there's always something that she does that completely destroys the plans that I'm trying to make. When I make plans, I usually like to think in-depth about them before I bring them to light. It's either that I'm being too hesitant to make plans, I'm being too much, or she's not communicating with me.\n\nI understand that there's a rule on this subreddit talking about \"No Moral Judgment Requests\" and I'm going to follow that, but I will say that it makes me seriously question if I'm being too much right now. \n\ntl;dr: I think about making plans with my girlfriend and she always beats me to it by making her own plans.","completion":"How many hours does he work in a week?

{"prompt":"My (35m) wife (27f) won't compromise and I feel like I'm losing my sense of self We got married quickly; 6 months into dating and we've been married and living together for a year and a half. Part of the reason was because she lived in another country and I didn't think long distance would work. I fell for her quickly and deeply; it felt like magic. She's beautiful, funny, and smart. I knew her moving to my country and in with me would a challenge, and most things we've worked through. There's one issue that persists; compromise.\n\nShe's extremely picky and unwilling to compromise. She draws hard lines in the sand and gets upset if I suggest something that’s outside of that. She beats down suggestions that she doesn’t like. “Why would we watch _____ during dinner?” “You know I don’t like that; why would you say that?” “Here’s the reason that’s bad and you shouldn’t have suggested it.” This applies to the small and big things; food we eat, videogames we play, shows we watch, what we buy, where we live, our schedule. We’ve had many talks about these issues individually, which generally comes down to her explaining why her preference is what it is, and why that’s our best option. She agreed to say no more gently, but doesn’t agree that she could be more flexible. She says she shouldn’t have to watch / play / do something she doesn’t want to.\n\nThe big issue right now is that also applies to where we live. She’s only willing to live in Toronto or Vancouver, and not for a career reason. She’s still figuring out her career, and so I’m paying 80% of the bills. I got a good job offer (+$10k) in a smaller city (population 500,000) that’s an hour from Toronto and she said there’s no way she’d live there. She says I don’t consider her if I suggest something she doesn’t want. She says “we decided”, and “we want” as if we decided on something equally, but many times what I want isn’t welcome at the table of decision making. We decide between the the things that she wants and at the end she feels like we had equal say. She does ask for my opinion on things daily, but I feel like my choice is between yes and an argument. I find myself suggesting only what I know she likes and pushing down my wants.\n\nMy dad asked me to play a couple games of chess so I said to her “Do you mind if I play a couple games of chess with my dad after dinner?” I played for an hour and she was upset with me. My best friend made a comment that we only hang out when she’s busy, and he’s right. I don’t feel like I can just hop on a videogame with him when she’s here without her getting upset. I’m flexible so it wasn’t a big deal at first, but I’ve been feeling an increasing anxiety and constriction. I knew that I would lose some autonomy with marriage, but this feels like a lot. I find myself sitting in my car after work and looking forward to time she has planned with friends.\n\nI want to live in a place that has a reasonable cost of living. I want to see my family more. I want to play the videogames I like. I want to watch documentaries. I want to get back into photography. I want to feel like I can just do something because I feel like doing it. My friend said I should just do those things, and be ok with her getting upset. Should I just brute force this thing? I want to make this work; I really love her.\n\nTLDR: My wife is picky and not willing to compromise. I feel like I’m losing autonomy and conversations with her haven’t improved the situation much.","completion":"Who could’ve guessed that marrying someone you barely knew would be a mistake?\n\nHave you told her how you feel?"}

There’s one man at work I get along with. We talk about lots and I see more of a friend in him than some of the girls at work, who are nice enough but kind of cliquey and keep to their friendship groups.

My IG is clean and kid-friendly, but I used to use it as a model account before I had a child - I worked in adverts and also did catalogue work so underwear, bikinis, etc. It's not the posts, or my pictures that upset him.He asked me if I chatted to other men, he meant especially flirty messages or entertaining attention from other men. I said, I didn't - I have never once flirted with anyone since we have been together, let alone made myself available in one way or the other. My interactions on IG are mostly with women nowadays, and the odd reaction to a man's story, or brief exchanges with former colleagues (also in the model industry, yes some men) or acquaintances but I have been a former model and I did used to get a lot of male attention that I would usually ignore. He said, I was lying when I said I wasn't chatting to any guys because the actions above, which are totally harmless from my point of view, were still 'chatting to men'. I explained to him that the way he had initially asked me specified flirting and actively developing a friendship or relationship with other men, and I've never done that. The context was different. If he had asked me if I interacted with other men I would have said yes. He's still set on the fact that I was lying and has now demanded (yes, I'm aware how that sounds, but he was very upset) that I deactivate my account because this isn't the first time we had an argument about IG. He thinks I am oblivious to the many ways men flirt with me. Maybe he's right, maybe I don't notice every flirty attempt but I genuinely have never engaged with anyone flirting with me. I asked him to go through my IG messages but he didn't want to. He admitted that he did in the past and when I asked him if he had seen anything concerning he said, he said can't remember specifics but there were guys sending heart reactions and heart emojis or 'you're hot' in story replies. I said I don't engage with those replies but he still doesn't like that they're creeping on me. I also said if there was anything concerning I had done, surely he would remember?I know a lot of people say, asking SO to take down social media is a red flag but I don't necessarily believe so.\n\nHe's not the controlling kind of guy and I don't use IG that much anymore - he doesn't have it at all.

Regardless of the reason, the fact is, you left a hole that someone else filled. When you come to terms with this and accept your role in what happened, you'll be able to move on and learn from the experience. Otherwise, your brain will latch onto every detail and make you relive all of it over and over in perfect, crisp detail. This is how PTSD happens. You have to internalize this. You have to accept it.

{"prompt":"I(M26) want to go work overseas but I don't want to leave my daughter behind with GF(F26) My(M26) and my gf(F26) have been in a relationship for 4 years now and have a beautiful 3 years old daughter I'd fight the whole world for. A little about myself I'm from a middle class family(average income 500$ a month) from where I'm from but in my wife's country, we were live, I'd be considered lower class/income(average income 1200$ a month) where as my gf comes from money where she spends every single penny of her 4000$ monthly allowance for shopping and what not. She does take me out for fancy dinner and trips and I contribute what ever i can, never took advantage of her nor her money. I was brought up in a way to value relationship, ethics and morals rather than material wealth or things and have been very mature and responsible for a very young age. I moved here for college and met my gf during my final year. I wasn't actually looking for something serious but things happened and after I graduated we had our daughter. Her parents didn't take it too well and have cut all ties and stop supporting her. Although she didn't have much contact asides from getting her allowance to begin with. She was raised by her grandparents. \n\nFrom then on I did what ever i could to support her, i got monetary support from my parents and her grandparents not as much as her previousallownace but liveable. I took care of our daughter during the first 6 months changing diapers, feeding her at night, bathing her, cooking, shopping, cleaning the whole nine yards. I've read about postpartum and all the hormonal changes so i made sure my gf had nothing to do but just rest, recover and bond with the baby. We soon move in with her grandparents in the country side where they helped alot and treated me like their own. We spent 2 year there. There wasn't much of an opportunity for work there so I had to found one an hour away (700$a month) . Even when I was working full time I'd commute to and from work and look after my daughter, days off and holidays included from the moment she wakes up till she falls asleep. \n\nI understand that GF comes from money and being from another country might have different values but she still keeps on spending like she gets her 4k allowance, 1200$ on feeding bottles, 350$ for a blanket, 2000$ for a storeller that we didn't even use and lots more extravagant and luxury baby items that my daughter out grows in a few months or just sits there catching dusts. We had our ups and downs but I've been there for her breaking my back and my bank trying to make things work. She'd just borrow money from random people, my finds and family or buy stuffs on stores credit and not pay them back. I don't even know how she's get them to lend her money but most of them will tell me 2 or 3 months later saying that didn't have the heart to tell me that she borrowed money and haven't returned it yet. I'd have to scramble and find ways to repay them, even taking loans. She once kicked me out of her grandparents place but when the grandparents found out, they gave her an earful and took me back in. I've tried talking to her, I've tried hiding money, I've tried not giving her money but nothings working out. She takes money from her grandparents saying it's for me ( they don't know since we have a language barrier ). \n\nWe moved to the capital after I got a better paying job and her grandparents said they would support us and pay the school fees for our daughter, but she didn't want to stay at the apartment that I found saying it's too old and doesn't have more rooms. Or this or that and just wanted to rent an expensive condo which costs 90% of salary. I thought things would get better but its basically the same thing all over again. Irresponsible spending, not taking responsibility for her actions and making me to be the bad guy saying it's a man's job to provide. I'm working 2 jobs busting my ass, doing the household chores, cooking and cleaning, dropping my daughter off to kindergarten and picking her up, while she just sleeps when my daughter's at school, goes through shopping apps and just spend more money. I'm getting sick and tired of this. I want to try to make things work but she's just unbearable, entitled, stubborn, and narcissistic too. She wasn't like this when we were dating but maybe she didn't show her true colors than since she didn't have any responsibility nor have to budget her money. I've been living in debt worrying about how or when I can pay rent and bills while the money she receives from her grandparents are spend on frivolous and unnecessary things for my daughter. I've always tried to be empathatic with her but i feel so miserable and guily borrowing or asking money to make ends meet. I couldn't even help my struggling family back at home and instead asking them to send money. \n\nI recently go a job offer overseas with a great pay and benifits but the contracts 4 years long and I'm not sure oh what to do. On one hand I want to go so as that I can start saving money for my daughter's future but on the other hand I want to be there for my daughter and her milestones. I'm still with GF because of my daughter, we are not married nor registered, even though I have my name as the father on the birth certificate, I have 0 parental rights over my daughter as in her country the mother gets full custodial and parrtnal rights if not married. And I fear that if I leave i wont get to see my daughter anymore and she will just poison my daughters mind and make the bad guy. She already does that, when I don't give her money to buy things she will hype my daughter telling her they will go buy something but then say your dad doesn't have or won't give money to buy said thing which really breaks my heart to see my daughter's sad face. \n\nI wanted to send her to my home country as my parents are willing and able to look after her unlike hers who i haven't even met till now. There's good free education and Healthcare while here the public schools are very bad and the good private schools as well as healt care costs a fortune. She's refuses saying she doesn't want our daughter to grow up poor(people live a very good life there and don't focus on bonds and relationships instead of being materialistic) and specially not with my poor parents who can't give her money to spend anymore( because they cant and shes calling them poor since they cant shell our the large amounts of cash like her family can ), the same parents that were very supportive and welcoming to her and our daughter, the same parents who have sent years worth of their savings just so their granddaughter could see their granddaughter ( she refuses to let them talk with daughter if they don't send money or contribute to her ridiculoussoendinf). \n\nSo if I go work overseas so I could atleast have some sort of saving for my daughter's future but leave her behind with a mother like her. I really want what's right for my daughter even if I'm made a bad guy or can't be with her.","completion":"Imo kids need their parents. You are in a very tough spot. Best of luck either way"}

Drew is trans (biologically female and identifies as a man.) Drew strictly likes biological females. He has never dated, nor has ever wanted to date a man, whether cis or trans. Also extremely masculine! He is the kindest person I know, and has gone above and beyond with supporting me through my social anxiety and depression. Whether it was him admitting to wanting top surgery, to him coming out as trans, to cheating partners. I’ve always been there for him.\n\nAround the craziness of the holidays We were able to find literally 5 minutes for us to meet up between driving to functions. He was meeting my GF Miley (25F), who I’ve been dating for almost a year, for the first time. She has had a history of being jealous, and insecure but with me being a bit of a loner and being new to the area there wasn’t really anything or anyone to be jealous or insecure about. \n\nMe and Drew gave each other a massive hug, and I spun him around as I usually did. I immediately introduced him to Miley and we spoke briefly as I put The Christmas presents for Drew and his GF in his car. They seemed to get along well enough for a five minute chat. We said our goodbyes and as I was driving Miley looked really annoyed. I asked her what was wrong, and she refused to talk about it. I simply told her that I understand if she doesn’t want to talk about it now but I’m here if she changes her mind.after awhile she said it was in appropriate to have another person in my arms infront of her. I was confused as hell, and she clarified it was the hug me and Drew gave eachother. Drew was a man but because he was biologically female it was disrespectful. I asked her if she thought the hug was flirty, or inappropriate, and what about it was bad. She said that I spun him around and other then that there was nothing inappropriate. She told me I wasn’t allowed to hug him like that infront of her again.\n\nThis irked me because I have never tried to police her behaviors or actions. She has gone out to eat with her male friends one on one and the only thing I ask is for her to text me occasionally so I know she’s safe. I stood my ground, and explained that he was my bed friend and I’m not going to modify my behavior towards him. She said I wasn’t being considerate of her feelings.  She has a history of cheating on her partners, while I don’t . so I don’t know if this is somehow related to her past experiences. But maybe I’m too close to the situation, and this is something I’m not being compassionate about. Any advice?","completion":"She’s showing you who she is.

Went to the dog park with her and my dog and talked for hours.\n\nFast forward a month and we are talking over the phone still. I finally come back home on leave and pick her up for a second date. We went to the movies and fooled around a bit.\n Then after that day I didn’t see nor talk to her for 6 months. She started leaving me on read and giving one word responses. I got REALLY needy and asked her why she’s been quiet. She played it off like she was just really busy but I think she was just too nice to admit that it wasn’t working out.\n\nI eventually got really depressed for a whole 2 years and had a manic episode followed by a bipolar diagnosis.\nDuring this manic episode, I was drinking a lot and telling her how I think we could change the world and all this crazy stuff. \n\n I was hospitalized for a week until I was doing better. \n\nAfter I got myself together about a month later, I hit her up and apologized over Snapchat. \nShe was very understanding and told me if I ever want to talk or hang out just to ask.\n\nSo a month later I went to her place just to talk.

Im just hoping they were also too drunk to remember or notice. \n\nThen i asked him let's leave. So me, him, my friend and his friend went to his place. We made out in the car. At his place we drank a bit more, then the two of us went into a room. We started making out, we had sex and all of that. \n\nHe got real rough with his fingers, my period date was also close so they came. So i bled a lot and I'm pretty sure i got hurt also. So i went to clean up.\n\nHe was shit faced so he slept off by the time i came back. I wore my clothes, put a blanket on him and went outside to get a tampon from my bag, the other two were still sitting there, chatting. \n\nI put in the tampon, took off his glasses and his watch and slept beside him.\n\nIn the morning when we woke up, he had a hard on, he was still kinda in his sleep, hewas rubbing it against me. But I had a tampon in and stuff so i backed off a little. Then he got up said good morning, went to the washroom, did stuff around the house, not a word from his mouth. I noticed a light hickey on me and 3-4 v dark ones on him. And we're both in complicated relationships. I left soon, he gave me an awkward side hug and said bye. \n\nI called my friend and told her all that had happened, she told me he was on MDMA. He did it before he came to the party. He later texted her saying \"I dont even know how i got into that room, who let me go inside, it's all blurry, i don't remember\" and shit like that. She told me not to tell him that i know what he said to her because they work together closely and she can't afford losing his trust.\n\nWe both got really pissed. She said he wasn't that drunk that he wouldn't remember. I felt really bad and guilty because he was making it sound like i had forced him or he didn't want that. She said he's saying all that to her so that things dont get awkward between them and he was justifying his drunk horny behaviour in front of everyone.\n\nThen at 3 pm he texted me for a video i made in the party, i sent it at 5 and he said thanks. Then an hour later he texted me to ask if im alright. I did not reply, he sent me some reels on instagram also and i left them on read. \n\nWHAT DO I DO?","completion":"We met online 5 years ago. I just started working and she was a sophomore/junior in college. She maintained a near 4.0 in undergrad and then a 4.0 in graduate school (she is a LCSW). We dated for 2 1/2 years and got married at year 3, been together for over 2 years.\n\nThere were times back then when it seemed like she was “born yesterday”, but it wasn’t as frequent and no one is perfect. Part of why I didn’t notice is that she wasn’t doing house chores when we were dating (as she didn’t live with me full time)."}

{"prompt":"I(28M) can't buy a Valentine's Day gift for my girlfriend (28F) Hi everyone. \nI(28M) was saving money to buy a gift to my gf(28F) on Valentine's Day. We are in a LDR for about 2 years and I always buy her gifts on special occasions. The thing is, that the recent devastating earthquake in Turkey made me very sad and now I think that it would be better if I donate that money to the earthquake victims. I am worried that I may break her heart if I don't buy her a gift. I can buy her a cheap gift like a box of chocolates instead but I don't want. She doesn't deserve cheap gifts. I can't do both of these (gift and donation) because of my current financial situation.

{"prompt":"Dad(63M) won't let me go to an air bnb with friends for a night (18M) So pretty much, I(18M) graduated from high school recently and I am pretty much just waiting for uni to start, so I have plenty of free time these days. \n\nOne of my best high school friends(18M) is going to be moving to a different city to attend uni very soon, so one of my other friends(also 18M) came up with the idea that the 3 of us plus a couple of other friends(also all 18M) rent out an airbnb in the central city area for one night and split the cost, which was around $30 for each of us. \n\nHis plan was for us to just chill out, have a couple of drinks(legal age is 18 over here), just spend some time together, since it will be a long time before we see our friend again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, after careful planning of what to say when I ask my dad if I could go ahead with the plan(growing up I've always had to be super specific with every small detail whenever I went out), I was met with a \"NO\". I made sure I told him what the plan was, that my friend(who he knows pretty well) is going to be leaving, so we want to do something different before he leaves, but he still said no.  \n\nGrowing up, my dad has always been really controlling with me hanging out with friends, and especially sleep overs. My social life outside of school was pretty much restricted to weekends, which I can understand as I had greater responsibilities, like school. \n\nEvery time I did something with friends or had a sleep over, there was always like some sort of cooldown before I could do something socially again. Like my dad would say something like \"you just had a sleepover 2 weeks ago, there's no need to do that again\". Okay, fine. I was still a kid back then. But now that I am out of school, I thought things would be different now.\n\nI asked him why, and he told me that \"he doesn't see why we need to stay the night\", and that we could just \"spent an afternoon in the city\". He told me that he has 'already' let me have sleep overs in past, even though the last sleep over I had was literally 4 months ago. \n\nI don't understand him. I don't understand why there needs to be a 'good reason'? Like I'm literally out of school right now and there's nothing important that I need to be doing. Its not like I'm doing something bad either???\n\nI tried pressing him further to better understand where he came from, but eventually he got frustrated with me and just yelled \"THE ANSWER IS NO.\"\n\nThis plan is completely unassociated with my dad, I am using my own money that I got from working part time, and my transport is taken cared off. This isn't even an expensive trip. He knows that I won't be doing anything stupid, and he has met most of my friends and knows they are all great people. Literally everyone going there is a guy, so it's not like I'm going to get in trouble sexually.\n\nI've always been a good kid growing up. I've never gotten into any trouble, did pretty well in school, barely attended parties, made good friends, never gotten any speeding tickets or broken driving laws, never did drugs or drank early, never did anything to break my parents trust. \n\nI was tempted to pull the \"I'm 18 and you can't tell me what to do\" card, but I also know he technically has the ability to kick me out of the house legally, so I didn't say anything about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am extremely disappointed, frustrated and jealous of my friends right now. All my friends' parents allowed them to go, yet my dad won't let me go without even giving me a fair reason.\n\nI know people from other friend groups the same age as me that have literally gone on vacation to DIFFERENT COUNTRIES TOGETHER FOR WEEKS AT A TIME!!! \n\nI know people that partied multiple times a week during high school, did drugs and alcohol, were able to sleep at random people's houses, and their parents were fine with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand my dad wont let me stay ONE FUCKING NIGHT at an airbnb in the SAME CITY????? im sorry, but i  think this is unfair and complete bullshit\n\ni wish i had just fucking lied to him and said i was just gonna stay the night at a friends house\n\nthis really fucking hurts, im going to be missing out on a fun night with my friends. but im not going to ruin their fun and ask them to change the plan because of me.","completion":"How is he going to stop you???"}
{"prompt":"Boyfriend (19m) leaves me (19f) to clean up after him Ok so I’m not sure if anyone else has this but me (19f) and my boyfriend (19m) have been together nearly 3 years now and we live together for 2 years. We moved in together for family reasons which I won’t get into but regardless we’ve enjoyed it, we’ve agreed we wouldn’t be able to live apart anymore and we enjoy it more this way. We have busy work lives and so only see eachother as we’re getting ready to go and then from 7pm onwards, except our 1 maybe 2 day/s off if we’re lucky. For context I work from home.\nSince living with him I’ve noticed I’m left with all cleaning jobs, picking up his clothes right next to the basket and actually putting them in there, washing them, drying, ironing, folding, putting away. Making the bed with his pillows a certain way for when he gets home, hoovering, looking after our axoltl which he bought and I didnt want, wiping his crumbs off the bed, we cook together but all he does is cook the meat part of the meal I prepare it and season it and make everything else that goes with it, I do every dish needed. everything is done by me. There’s certain things I’ve asked of him to make my life easier as I only have an hour after finishing work to do all this for us. I ask, he wipes his feet before getting into bed, close drawers/cupboard doors behind him and turn lights off as he leaves the room and probably some other little things but I don’t remember. Today is my day off, I didn’t get to sleep till 5am as I have been quite unwell. Come 7am he’s getting ready for work, he ends up pulling the blanket off me, being incredibly noisy and left the light on. I immediately woke with a headache and turned the light off and closed the cupboard doors and drawers behind him. There’s clothes all over the floor, his massive shoes in the middle of the room and I’m stressed. For 2 years I’ve said I’ll do everything If you could please make a habit of closing things behind you and turning lights off if I’m asleep as I will wake up with a headache  and once I stand up to turn it off, that’s it I’m awake. \nIt’s not happened, not a single improvement, I’ve tried doing kind little reminders when I’ve noticed and he’ll say ‘oh I was actually going to this time’ I’ve tried pointing out when I’ve had to do it and he’d say ‘I just don’t think to, you don’t have to point it out everytime I mess up’ bc I was pointing it out everytime, to show how often it was (several times a day) and today I lost it, I told him I feel like I’m mothering him bc I’m having to do everything behind him, and get no consideration and it’s to the point that if it does continue for much longer I know I’ll lose all attraction for him bc I’ll feel like he’s a child and can’t do anything for himself. I can send him to a shop with a list and I’ll get 2 things off it maybe? Bc he ‘forgets to look’ the only reason I give a list is bc he’ll forget if I just tell him, I can’t even call hi. And remind him to check it because he’ll ‘not hear his phone’ I told him, please make these things a habit or I’m going to reconsider us as I don’t want a man child. He told me ‘I make a mistake and you’re going to make me feel like an idiot for it and then leave me?’ I’m at a loss, I’ve tried everything I can think of, it’s not a mistake, it’s multiple, daily. My siblings are 10 and 12 and they turn a light off as they leave the room for school. Does anyone have advice to help him remember these things as he’s the first person I’ve ever met to leave drawers open after using them. It’s everytime I’ve never seen him close them unless we’re at my mums house. All he says is that he doesn’t ask me to do any of it so I should complain but I’d I don’t do it nobody will.\n\n\nTLDR: boyfriend forgets to close drawers, turn lights off, clean anything behind him,leaves it to me but says ‘I didn’t ask you to’ if I remind him.","completion":"If he doesn't know the address of where you'll be staying, just go and deal with the consequences after. One day you're going to have to live a life that doesn't involve getting his permission to breath, and missing out on a night like that with friends is almost tragic at your age. \n\nHope you'll be staying on campus once the school year starts. Your dad has serious control issues."}

He has the easy life right now. You need to stop taking care of the axolotl and tell him ‘your pet needs feeding/I haven’t cleaned your pet’s tank and I’m not going to, you need to’. Obviously please don’t let the poor thing die or suffer but this is HIS pet and he needs to start acting like it. Then, ONLY do your laundry, only do YOUR dishes, start doing HALF of everything else. If he’s not budging, start dumping his dirty shit on his half of the bed - if he wants to go to bed that night he’ll need to do something about the pile of dirty dishes there. If it gets to the point where he uses up all the dishes, get different coloured plates/cutlery etc that are only yours, which he’s not allowed to use. Tell him that on half the days in a week (be specific about which ones), you expect him to make dinner, and if he doesn’t then you’ll only be cooking your own meal. \n\nHave a very frank conversation with him about how unacceptable his behaviour is. My darling if you don’t start drawing some very hard lines about what you will and won’t accept, he’ll walk all over you for the rest of your relationship. If you have kids with this man, you’ll be burdened with 100% of the cleaning AND 100% of the childcare. And that will be a recipe for resentment, which will make you much less attracted to him, will probably halt your sex life and eventually lead to a relationship breakdown. \n\nIF YOU DON’T SET THESE BOUNDARIES ASAP, you’re going to sleepwalk into a whole life of being a servant.

{"prompt":"How to move forward after (60M) dad's girlfriend/pseudo-step mom (60F) snapped at me (30M and my partner (30F) on vacation, a few months ahead of our wedding. *Warning: this is a long one. I’ll add a TLDR at the top, but put as much information as I feel comfortable sharing below for those that want the context. Apologies in advance, I am emotionally distraught and exhausted.*\n\n**TLDR;** my dad’s girlfriend snapped at my partner and I over asking her not to turn the lights off in our bedroom at a vacation rental, saying we are no longer welcome to travel with them in the future because we are disrespectful and unappreciative. The catch is, my partner and I are getting married abroad this summer (to which they are invited) and we are hosting them for a weekend in the fall as well as for Thanksgiving. I want to un-invite her from all of these events, but I don’t want to un-invite my dad or otherwise lose him in the process.\n\nThis week my partner and I have been on a family vacation, with my dad (60s) and Jane, and my brother and his wife (who we rarely get to see due to them living out of the country). For the most part, things were okay with just a few tense moments between Jane and either myself or my brother, mostly over small and trivial things (like crumbs being on a counter). All that changed this morning.\n\nAs we were all getting ready to leave for the day’s activity, Jane decided to make a lap of our accommodations and turn off all of the lights, something that I can get behind (who likes wasting electricity?). However, Jane went into our room and turned our lights off, but we were still in the process of getting ready albeit outside of the room discussing the day’s plan with the family – specifically, we were figuring out what we would need to wear or bring with us. We told Jane we were still using the lights and to please leave them on, but she told us we needed to turn the lights off to conserve electricity. I reminded her we were still getting ready, that we don’t pay for electrical usage at these accommodations, and that the electrical draw of two lamps with LED bulbs is minimal. That’s when she snapped at me, getting very agitated and saying, among other things, that we are no longer welcome to travel with them on future trips. I asked her to repeat herself and she said (paraphrased) “your dad and I won’t be traveling with you again since this is how you behave.”\n\nI snapped at this point, closing the door and packing my bag to avoid blowing up or saying something I would regret. I told my partner what happened as they were not present for the exchange, at which point Jane starting stomping around the rental and ranting and raving about how disrespectful and inconsiderate to my father my brother and I have been all trip.\n\nAt this point, I closed the door to our room and began packing my bags, then asked my dad to join me to talk about what just happened. I told him what Jane said, and how that is unacceptable for her to say to me, especially over something so trivial as wanting lights left on in our room that we were still using. He chose to defend her, and tell me that I need to learn to control my emotions while agreeing that what Jane said was out of line. I asked him to tell me what my brother or I have done that has been disrespectful, and he said he couldn’t think of anything specific and that he was not particularly bothered by anything that had had been said or done. I broke down at that point and confided in him that Jane has been rude and disrespectful to me my entire life, that I think she is toxic for my dad and that she is gaslighting him, as well as some information that my sister in law has shared with me. Apparently a year or two ago Jane had heard that in my SIL’s culture, daughters-in-law are to be treated like servants, and how despite my SIL telling her that’s not the case she has noticed that Jane continually treats her like a maid. It affected my SIL so much that on this trip she feigned having a migraine to lock herself in her room just to get away from Jane. My dad told me the racist thing Jane said “was a joke”, and I responded that clearly my SIL didn’t think so and honestly neither do I. He wanted to know what we could do to move past it, and I said I needed space to process what had happened, and that I did not want to see or speak to Jane until I was ready.\n\nJane came knocking on our door maybe 10 minutes later. I told her calmly not to come in and that I wasn’t ready, but she let herself in the room anyway. I repeated that I did not want to speak to or see her, but she ignored everything I was saying and said “I just want to apologize for snapping at you” and then turned heel and stormed out of the room. Obviously, I would never accept this disingenuous apology, and in fact it really made things worse. We made it clear she was not welcome in our room, by walking in and forcing me to hear her fake apology, she demonstrated that she does not respect me or my partner and believes she is entitled to our personal space because she’s my dad’s girlfriend.\n\nI spent the rest of the day fuming, but forced to interact with the group. Multiple times, my dad approached me to tell me some version of what he said before (I need to control my emotions, I can control my response, avoidance isn’t going to make things better, etc), and multiple times I told him that I’m not looking to make things worse but that I also am in no way open to talking to her at all and genuinely was not having a good time. Jane sulked the entire day, as if we were the ones to verbally assault her and threaten to cut her out of our life. The entire day was terrible and I am absolutely dreading the final day of our trip, which I feel awful about because I so rarely get to see my brother and SIL or spend quality time with my dad.\n\n**Now here’s the crux of the situation** and really what I’m here looking for advice on. This summer, my partner and I are having a micro-wedding abroad with just our two families, something we have been saving and budgeting for aggressively as we are NOT wealthy people. My dad and Jane are invited but the whole point of our micro-wedding is to make it an intimate gathering of just the family we want to share the moment with. Frankly I didn’t really want her there before the trip but especially after everything that happened, I do not want her there. Nor do I want them to visit us a few months later nor for Thanksgiving – both of these visits they intend to stay in our home.\n\nI love my dad, I don’t want him to be put in an awkward position where he is forced to choose between his partner and his son, but I don’t want to have this toxic person at our wedding or welcome her into our home. **How can I possibly come to terms with this and get past what happened, or conversely, how can I un-invite her from our wedding/our house/Thanksgiving without cutting my dad out of my life as a result?** I honestly am ready to cut Jane out of my life, but I also do not want to go back home with this hanging over my head. What do I do?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Forgot to include that Jane and my dad live together in a home they jointly own, and they have been together for about 15 years. Their relationship is complicated, where my dad calls Jane his wife but she won't marry him due to her deceased ex-husband and viewing marriage as for life (hence the girlfriend/pseudo-step mom label in the title).

With realizing there was a lot of outside noise that was also a cause we talked and got back together but created a mutual ultimatum. We were both very, very clear what we wanted to happen and needed to happen.

I asked him to go to therapy. He’s got major anger issues and uses weed to cope. Which is fine, but if he goes more than 24 hrs without smoking… that’s when things get intense. He’s never hurt me and has never threatened to hit me, abuse me, or anything. I’m not worried about that, just him breaking expensive stuff. IE one time he ripped up his favor bag and it cost like 80 bucks. We don’t/didn’t have the money to replace. We also are long distance right now after we broke up and he has no intention of moving closer to me (I have a really nice paying job and won’t find something similar pay to it back home). He wanted to get himself a vehicle for his birthday this month, and that was where the cut off for the ultimatum was. His birthday looms closer and I brought up the ultimatum again… he wants to do anger management classes instead of therapy. But your anger comes from something besides anger…\nI guess I’m looking for advice on how to break up with him. I’ve gone through most of the grieving process already about this (or so says my therapist).

It all came down to learning a mental exercise that I was to do every 30 minutes for several weeks.\n\nAn exercise where I ask myself,\n\n* How do I feel?\n* Why do I feel this way?\n* Is it valid to feel this?\n* What should I do next? (express myself or change how I feel)\n\nThis is something that worked for me, but I could have learned it from a class too.  I didn't need a therapist but that was the easiest way for me to get help.  If there is an anger management class it will probably be just as good.\n\nAs a side note: anger is a valid emotion.  It's OK and often correct to be angry.  It really comes down to how you express it.  You don't have to yell, break things, insult people, you can be angry and calm and focused and communicate yourself with obvious anger but calmly."}

But since there were no consequences to the overstepping and just the same, repeating, no-consequence talks... she just ignores her. \n\nActions normally have consequences. And there could be many - starting at not letting the MIL take part in the wedding preparations at all anymore, to deciding that she is not invited at all, to cutting contact... One of the facts in life is, bluntly said: In a situation like that, there are at least two people involved - the one who acts like an asshole and the one letting it happen. You and your fiance let this happen. You are letting others dictate your own wedding and, as a result, you are unhappy. The correct solution is that, while you can't change the MIL, you can change yourself and your own actions, thus forcing the MIL to change as well. But as long as neither you nor your fiance grow a spine and let people like your parents walk all over you, nothing will change and you will keep being ignored."}

His current partner deserves so much more and you don't want to be the person someone speaks to behind their partner's back.\n\nIf he valued your friendship at all, he wouldn't be letting this continue and wouldn't be leading you on with some of the comments he's making. \n\nYou also have to consider that there's a strong likelihood you don't know this person as well as you think you do. He reached out to you after a long friendship hiatus and kept this information from you. Would you keep that information from a friend or would you want them to know if you were in a relationship?

He think it’s okay because I did something to upset him but I find it disrespectful and like he’s trying to intimidate me or something.\n\nFor example; my dog who I’ve had since before meeting him, is having bad dental issues and he’s been bleeding from his mouth, especially when he scratches at it, so we have to keep a close eye on him to make sure he doesn’t make him bleed a lot. Well last night, he asked me to watch him so he could go shower &amp; eat, and I had accidentally fell asleep after 5 minutes because I decided to lay in bed instead of sitting up due to how tired I was and back pain I was having.\n\nThis started an argument about how I don’t care about him or my dog because if I cared I would’ve sat up to watch him instead of laying down. He went on about how he’s the main one watching him because I have to go to work and it’s not fair that I don’t do a better job watching him when I’m home. Now I’ll admit I should’ve sat up but I was extremely tired and just wanted to be comfortable, which I can understand does make it seem like I don’t care but I truly struggle to stay awake, it doesn’t matter if I took 3 power naps that day I am constantly fatigued. There has been times too where I do sit up and it’s like I black out because I’m stuck in that half awake mode. \n\nMy boyfriend also thinks I don’t care about him because I don’t check on him as much as he does me, which again I’ll admit is true but not because I don’t love/care about him, I just have a hard time being there for others when I’m depressed, I turn into a hermit crab. However again I do agree I should be better about checking on him since he too is depressed/anxious.\n\nAnyway multiple times during this argument, he got extremely close to my face and he even got mad when I backed away so he couldn’t do that like I was being disrespectful. This isn’t the first time either, he has done it many many times before.

She had never used a dating app before and was finally ready to start dating again. She texted us later that day and said she already had like 30 likes.\n\nA few days later she said over text that she had met someone that she's really excited about and was asking for advice. She and I send each other funny Instagram reels periodically, but I sent her a few over the past few days and she left me on read and it hurts.

{"prompt":"Is my (32F) new niece in law (21F) trying to throw shade at me? My husband (35M) and I just got married two weekends ago. My husbands family immigrated when he and his siblings were small children, so they grew up in the US and are Id say 80% aware of us customs (some things are still a suprise to him but that might just be because he himself is not super observant. The niece in question was born in the US. I mention all this because it has to do with US wedding etiquette. \n\nMy husband has a cousin who’s only a few years older than him. This cousin is very close, more like a sister since she lived with his family for a few years as a teen. During that time this cousin had daughter. Husband (and the rest of the family) were obviously always super close with this daughter since she was raised in their house for the first few years of her life til her mom got on her feet with her own place. \n\nFast forward. This niece is now 21. She still looks up to my husband a lot as he was one of only a few prominent male figures in her life. I get along fine with her, or I think so anyways. \n\nI wanted her to feel like she was part of the wedding, but didn’t feel comfortable with her being a bridesmaid as my husband suggested because I only had my two best friends whom I’ve known for 15 years as my bridesmaids, and while I know she’s important to my husband it’s as a niece, not the same level as like a daughter, they’re not that close. Instead I asked her to read a poem during the ceremony. \n\nNiece is not exactly a model of modesty. Her usual outfit is a crop top with no bra and low cut jeans that are mostly holes. Doesn’t bother me, if I were her age with her body and confidence I would do the same, she rocks it. It’s such a non issue in my brain that I didn’t talk to her at all about what to wear for the wedding, as it literally never occurred to me to care about what she was wearing. \n\nDay of the wedding. She stands up to read her poem on stage. She’s wearing a pure white slip dress that looks like it cost about 17 cents to make because of how little fabric there is and how flimsy and see through the fabric is. No bra. 5 inch glitter stilettos. I only vaguely notice this because of my own nerves on being in front of a crowd and you know, it’s my wedding and all. \n\nA few days later Im texting with one of my bridesmaids and she mentions how completely flabbergasted she was niece’s outfit. Not only the skimpy-ness but also the fact that she wore white, and how offensive that is. She asked what her problem with me is and if we’ve had beef before. I’m taken aback because it never occurred to me that she might have done that on purpose to be petty? \n\nTLDR my niece in law wore a skimpy white dress to my wedding in which she was participating in the ceremony - should I assume she’s mad at me about something? Like did she want to be in my wedding party and this was how she “got back” at me? I thought we got along fine but everyone in my circle thinks there’s no way that wasn’t deliberate and that I should be mad","completion":"Your friend is the shit-stirrer, not your niece. While yes, wearing white to someone's wedding is generally considered a bad social move, it also literally means nothing except people coming up with fake rules to be mad at each other about. \n\nEven if she was trying to throw shade, the best way to win is not be mad about it at all. \n\nWhy get upset at something you didn't even notice?\n\nEdit: and on top of that, if anyone else noticed that she wore white, what everyone else will take away from this is that your niece was rude and you were super classy and just ignored it."}
{"prompt":"My SO M30 and I F30 finacial spending habit tracking system needs improvement. How do other couples track finances? How do couples track spending habits?\n\nMy SO M(30) and I F(30) have had a joint checking, savings, and credit card for about 6 years.\n\nI handle the finances, and I really like my system, but I am becoming increasingly annoyed at my husband for not following the system.\n\nI haven't used an app in a long time. My moms account is somehow tied to mine. I can see hers, but she can't see mine. It messed up my budget app. \n\n\nThe system:\n- 2 individual checking accounts where i give us both an allowance for the month on personal things. This is for things that are specifically for oneself, like work lunch, buying clothes, and going out with friends.\n \n- the joint checking is where the allowance comes from, it pays the bills, including the joint credit card.\n\n- the joint credit card is what we use to go on dates, and buy things for the house like groceries, pet food, gas, car repair, etc. \n\n\nWhy this system?\nFor me, it helps me see what my habits are, and it makes me feel good when i save up for something instead of just buying it. For example, i think i should have to save \"my own money\" (aka my allowance) for a dyson blow dryer, or to get my hair done. I think it helps understand our spending habits as individuals and as a couple. \n\n\nWhat's not working?\n-my husband often times will use the joint card instead of his personal one by accident. This makes it hard to identify joint spending habits vs individual. \n \n-online purchases are more difficult to avoid using the joint card. Amazon, for example, has a minimum for free shipping (no i do not subscribe, i hate subscriptions) so sometimes there personal things in a household order. The description on the joint card doesn't identify items. Anyway, I'm sure you get the point.\n \n-we come from different financial backgrounds. I'm more likely to hunt for the best price and he has become reluctant to spend anything cuz he knows he forgets to use the right card or he doesn't want to search for a good price.\n\n \n\nAnyways, that's my somewhat failure of a system. Suggestions?\n\n\n\nTl;dr: 2 personal checking accounts used for personal wants and splurging on oneself. Joint accounts used for bills, dates, groceries, etc. There are issues of using joint accounts for personal things, making it harder to budget. Suggestions?","completion":"We work a similar system, but it’s all through a single bank.

He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7-8 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I knew that I wanted to break it off for him for a little while and kept pushing it off. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality and a million other things at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. I wasn’t seeking a relationship nor really anything else. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I don’t remember what our original conversation was about. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him.

I would just consider your little episode a girl crush which is fairly common.   \n\n\nRead about the AA program Step 8 and 9 and they will give you good advice on making amends to people. It's all about thinking of how we have hurt someone and when to tell them and ask forgiveness and make amends and when not to tell them. In the not to tell advice, they say it is better to make \"living amends\" which is aligning your behavior with your value system rather than blurting out something that will only hurt them because you want to get it off your conscience.   \n\n\nIn your case, had you had intimate relations with your girl crush, your boyfriend needs to know the truth. Being infatuated with another female is different especially when you were broken up with your boyfriend.

{"prompt":"My (19F) boyfriend (22M) refuses to go to therapy and instead went to see girls behind my back.. Hi, so to five background My (19F) boyfriend (22M) have been together for about 3 years. \n\nThe issue started 3 months ago when I officially broke up with him because our relationship has truly turning to shit over the past year. He was very mean with me, refused to do any effort (organize dates or activities for example, because « that’s not his thing »), whenever I went to see him we would just stay in his basement room for days, not doing anything ( i would scroll on Tiktok or watch movies and he would play video games), our bedroom life was basically dead (which he blamed me for, but I kept telling him, i’m not going to be attracted to you if my brain is literally not stimulated at all while we’re together) etc, etc.\nDuring our relationship he was very adamant to me going out with my friends, every time I would go out he would give me attitude which led me to being very anxious the entire nights so I just stopped going out as much as possible. There was an instance where me, a girl friend and two guy friends rented an airbnb and chilled over there (I did invite my boyfriend but « it’s not his thing »), and for him that was the breaking point. He said me going out with a girl and two guys is very disrespectful, even though we’re long term friends (like since middle school) so after that I stopped going out completely. This eventually led me to lose all my friends.\nHe also regularly asked me to change my outfit if he didn’t approve of what I was wearing, and out of respect and not wanting him to throw a fit, I did.\n\nComes this one time when I’m just walking downtown after a shift at the restaurant I work at, some guy I don’t recognize approaches me and calls me by my name. He then proceeds to introduce himself as my literal primary school best friend, I was so shocked and super happy to see him. We saw each other the following day and the day after. He knew I had a boyfriend and never did anything to interfere with that. But my boyfriend wanted me to stop seeing him. Ultimately I said no, that’s unfair our friendship is respectful. His basis is that we spent too much time together (3 days in a row, and then in the following 2 more days, each after my shifts). This was also after I lost all my friends and my boyfriend had started treating me poorly, so it was nice to have a breath of fresh air. Comes down to one day my old friend sent me the following message « you’re such a babe » in response to something I had said and that was the breaking point for my boyfriend, I had to delete him.\nI want to note that none of my masculine friendships (i have about 5 male childhood friends), were ever disrespecting of me, my boyfriend or my relationship. Never hit on me, never attempted anything, they all know my mom and i’ve all known them before puberty.\n\nFast forward when we break up because I’m tired of a relationship that’s going no where. I mean since the beginning of the relationship i’m the one organizing things and I’m always making sure he gets his things done. He has a sedentary « bare minimum » lifestyle because his mom always did everything for him. I had asked him, that if he wants us to stay together, he must build a minimal routine and stick to it; going to sleep at 5am and waking up at 3pm everyday is not healthy, not reading or doing any intellectual activity is not healthy, not moving your body is not healthy, only consuming video games and media is not healthy, only eating when your mom makes something (whichis not everyday) and not being able to cook your own meals is not healthy… etc. Ultimately, I just wanted us to build healthy habits because now is the time to do so. In the 3 years we’ve been together he has not changed one bit. I was active, social, top student and motivated before meeting him. I now have social anxiety, failed a year and on concerta because of my lack of motivation. I’m not saying it’s his fault because ultimately I make my own choices, but I just believed him every time he said he would do something. \n Every time he has asked me to listen to him, his advice was rooted in satisfying his ego. For example, he wanted me to cut off all my male friends on the basis that « as a man, no other man should even get a word out of your girl » like ??????? This is where I drew the line and told him, it’s too much. Your ego is fragile and you need therapy. He says no, it’s just a preference.\n\nRealistically, he does need therapy; his father was abusive towards his entire family, in return his mom was cold and never listened to him. His entire friend group which he has had since middle school is composed of entirely misogynistic men (joke about raping women or threaten rape when rejected, call women « females », serial cheaters, actt in love with a girl just to have sex etc… ». Now he never sees them anymore but this is the kind of mentality that he grew up with. That says he was around toxic masculinity his entire life and would greatly benefit from therapy.\n \n\n(…missing half is in comments)\n\nTl:Dr: My boyfriend refused to to take accountability for the disrespect he had towards me and instead blames me for it. We’re currently y not together but I agreed to go back with him if he went to therapy. He agreed on the account that I listen to him. I’m weary because he does have controlling requests. Is the risk of being in a controlling relationship be worth him possibly healing in therapy oy and us having a successful relationship","completion":"Why do you want to get back with him?\n\nYou’re too young to waste your life on him.\n\nTime to spread your wings and find someone who isn’t a nasty shitty douchebag."}

{"prompt":"22M 23F // relationship advice needed Now this is going to be long\n\nI love this boy. We dated for a few months but our relationship went through an extremely difficult phase, at the end of which - we called it quits. He went through extreme emotional turmoil that turned into mental illness. He was severely depressed and anxious. Memories of his ex relationship were triggered as soon as he returned to university for his last semester. He didn’t have many friends. The ones he did, he mostly fell out with and any friends he had there were the ones he had made through the ex. It was an extremely difficult period for him. I was there for him throughout. I tried my best and I think I did better than anyone else would’ve. I helped him get in touch with his ex (little did I know how toxic she was) - they got in touch. I think she took advantage of the situation and his vulnerability and pushed all of his buttons to reel him back into the cycle they went through right after their breakup. Where was I through all of this? I had no choice but to leave because he said he thinks he still might love her. \n\nCut to a month later, they have a pact. But, that pact broke soon. We both became friends again but it was clear that there were feelings we both still had for one another. His ex returned and tarnished his mental health yet again. He was suffering again. His panic attacks began to return. He was breaking down again. I cannot begin to explain to you how heartbreaking it was for me to see him like this. I went through the initial episodes during the time we were together with him too (this was about 5 months). We didn’t really get a chance to be together after he went back for his last semester. We only got to be with each other for 3 months as a new couple. I fell in love with him deeply but the last 5 months of our “dating period” which turned into a long distance relationship while he was away was so difficult. I made sure I was available at all times, whenever he needed me. It did hurt that all of his trauma had to do with his ex. When we broke up, I didn’t talk to him for a month. We started speaking again as I mentioned above - his ex made sure to mess his mental health up even more. I made sure I was there for him again and I was. I’d try to make plans to see him, hang out, we’d even hook up in between and yes I’d give into my feelings - I advised him the best I could, I even helped him start his own business, encouraged him to take part in activities, one he joined because of me and it’s a permanent part of his everyday now but a while back, things got too much for him and he started to contact his ex (just the same way he was when he wanted closure) - she had a habit of saying traumatic things and disappearing. \n\nNow, I think he’s doing better. I have tried to pursue a relationship with him again as I do feel we both have feelings. The physical chemistry we have is the best we ever had. It’s unparalleled. However, he says he doesn’t want to be with me. I just wanted to start again or get to know each other again. I feel that we were robbed.

He says he likes me but he's hesitant to make things official because he still going through some emotional stuff from his divorce. \n\nHe lives an hour away and every date we've gone on, I've driven up to his area for us to do something. The one time he was going to drive to my area for a date, he canceled at the last minute. \n\nEverytime we have a conversation over text or phone call, he always brings up sex, like he'll ask me to send nudes or just start doing dirty talk. For example I said one time \"I wish I could see you so we could cuddle rn\" and he responded \"so I can press my hard cock into you and grab your titties\" and that's kinda how a lot of our conversations go. \n\nSo last night I came over to his place and we were going to hang out for valentines day and it just so happened I was on my period. I warned him of this beforehand and he said it would be fine. So I get there, and I brought food for us, and before even eating, I go into the bathroom to take my contacts out. He comes in behind me and starts trying to pull my pants down while my fingers are literally in my eye, I ask him to stop so I can finish and as soon as I'm done I say that I'm ready to eat but instead of letting me eat, he starts trying to mess around again and i kept repeating that I was hungry and wanted to eat first (I hadn't eaten in 12 hours and he knew this) \n\nSo eventually we go eat and then afterwards we start getting into things.

{"prompt":"My grandfather (79M) is dying and I (18F) feel nothing. throwaway so no one recognises me.\n\n1 (18F) am currently in a situation of being between a rock and a hard place. Currently, my grandfather is in and out of hospitals regularly due to heart issues. This is taking a huge toll on my dad (50M) emotionally, since my grandfather is his dad, and I can tell that he's really hurting- the both of them.\n\nOnly thing about this situation is that my family doesn't know that my grandfather [sa'd] me as a child for many years, in which he always told me to remain quiet about. There have been so many instances of me sitting at a table across from him and I've fought off every urge to look him in the eye and tell him that I'll never forgive him and that I hope he rots in hell for the rest of his life. Granted, I never did it out of wanting to keep the peace. He hasn't done anything to me in a long time, and no one in my immediate family knows.\n\nWith all this being said and my grandfather seeming to be inching closer to death, it's getting very hard for me to hide my apathy towards the situation. My dad brought me aside last night to tell me that he had been rushed to the hospital due to him going into what is basically congestive heart failure, and I just felt... nothing. I felt no remorse, no joy- it was like it was just a fact that someone had told me.\n\nMy current partner is aware of my situation, as well as a small number of my friends, but I'm trying to figure out how to break the news of this situation to my family. Do I wait until his passing? Do I tell someone now? I feel as if I wait until he passes that it wouldn't give him the opportunity to confess, therefore leaving my accusation up in the air. But I don't know if I'm ready to do it now-doing it now would put my father in so much more pain than he's already in, and he's the main person that I want to focus on right now.\n\nWhat do I do?","completion":"I don’t think it I know it if you escape from prison and you get caught you go back in with more time added to your sentence and it’s same in every country I know"}

Now he's made friends and feels awkward calling me when he's out. But i let that pass.\n\nI havent seen his face in one month, other than the pictures we had taken in  the past.\n\nHe never bothered to talk about our relationship problems first, its always me who has to start it.

What leverage she has would depend on your local laws plus things like who owns the domicile/whose name is on the lease if it's a rental. She should definitely speak to a lawyer who can outline whatever possibilities might exist for her to force him to move out. She'll probably have to file for divorce to be able to do that.

I met the girl and got a strange vibe off of her one day when they were going to hang out.

Today it has been exactly two weeks and he has not came to see me nor talked to me to make the situation better. I have been obsessing and wondering what i’ve did wrong these 2 weeks they have been the worst of my life. Yesterday I finally decided to remove him from my contacts, remove his location and remove him from my socials. Did I make the right decision? There has been no closure I just sent him a text breaking up with him but i’m not sure he even took it seriously i’ve been spamming him but now i’m finally tired. He won’t text me or pick up my calls. Should I remain hopeful that he will come make things right or just let him go? Is it time to move on for me? We were together for 2 years and it’s hard to believe he wants to end things this way.","completion":"You did the right thing. He doesn't love you anymore, it's time to let him go. There are better people out there. I know heartbreak sucks but you deserve better."}

{"prompt":"I feel like my (26f) boyfriend (28m) still has feelings for his ex best friend I feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for his ex best friend\n\nMe (26f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been dating for four years. We have a great relationship usually and we are genuinely each others best friends. But before we began dating he had this girl best friend (27f), they were very close, used to hang out all the time, talk most days and would even share a bed if he stayed over at her place. He admitted to me that he had a crush on her but that she was not interested in him so nothing happened romantically between them.\n\n\nWhen we began dating I was keen to meet her but she was pretty rude towards me during our first interaction and showed no interest which completely threw me off. She would then proceed to invite my boyfriend to lunches and dinners or over to stay at her house and exclude me, which annoyed my boyfriend as he felt it was purposeful and unnecessarily mean of her, so he would try to include me in the plans which would then make her uninterested and the plan wouldn’t go ahead. If we ever were all together in a group setting she would make me feel highly uncomfortable and do things like be very overly touchy feely with him, behaving in a girlfriend-like manner. One time even grabbing his leg under the table and said “we never hang out just us anymore” giving him puppy dog eyes, to which my boyfriend replied to her saying that they can still hang out just with me now also. \n\nSo essentially this sort of behaviour went on for awhile and at this point it’s safe to say I did not like her at all. She failed to be the cool person I thought she might have been and ended up being the stereotypical “girl best friend”. She moved cities so we stopped hearing from her as much and I grateful that my boyfriend respected me and our relationship enough to put boundaries in place with her without me even having to ask.\n\nIt’s been at least 3 years since then and we haven’t heard from her, we only have her on socials so I know she’s in a long term relationship now. But about four months ago I noticed my boyfriend had been liking her selfies which isn’t a common occurrence. So I asked him about it, after some time he said that he’s missing the friendship and is just thinking about old times with her. I tried to be understanding toward him but I also wanted him to understand how that doesn’t particularly make me feel good about myself or secure in the relationship considering he has liked her as more than just a friend before. He said her posts just show up on his feed and that gets him thinking about the past so then he likes the selfie. The topic was then dropped, but I didn’t really feel reassured by him and truly felt maybe it was more than just a friendship he was mourning.\n\nSo then I did something that I probably shouldn’t have, I muted her account on his Instagram so that her posts would no longer show up in the main feed, so that he would stop always seeing what she’s doing and thinking of her so intensely. I know that doing that was a breach of privacy and I shouldn’t have done it in hindsight, but at the time I felt justified to do it as a way to try and halt what was happening and partly to see if he would still go out of his way to react to her posts and stories.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I was using his phone (we use each-others phones for things openly) and I saw there was messages on Instagram between them, nothing that interesting but he had messaged a response to something on her story, she gave a meek reply and eventually left his final message on seen. She seemed fairly disinterested in the convo. Then I check her profile and he’s liking her posts, which means he’s been going out of his way to check up on her, and judging from the story reply it seems he wanted a way to strike up a conversation. \n\nNow it’s really not the conversation or the liking of the posts that is getting to me it’s the lying and the going out of his way to constantly check up on this girl after all this time. I just have to wonder why. I mean, I have old guy best friends from my past that I miss from time to time and think of them fondly but I don’t do what my boyfriend is doing. I appreciate that we have all grown up and moved on with our lives, moved cities etc, and they all have long term relationships now and I respect that.\n\nSo, I confronted him and just told him that I’ve tried to be understanding of the situation but I feel like it’s more than a friendship feeling that he’s harbouring for her, and that it’s making me feel really sad. He became defensive and began to yell and said he only interacts with her because she comes up on his feed, so I admitted to him that I muted her and so he’s lying. \n\nBut now this whole topic of conversation has been derailed because he is now only focusing on the fact that I muted her without his knowledge. I know that was wrong of me to do and I have been apologetic toward him for that, but I also feel like he’s now using this as a scapegoat to get out of explaining himself and his feelings toward her (which he claims is non-romantic) so he’s not addressing it properly at all.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here. He’s saying that he had to drop her from his life because of me, which annoys me that he’s putting that blame entirely on me when I was the one who was excited to met her in the beginning and she didn’t want a bar of it. It’s like he’s completely forgotten how she had behaved and how he set boundaries with her. I feel like he regrets doing so. I just don’t know how to handle this now or what to do. I love him an incredible amount but I don’t want to feel like I’m his second choice. It doesn’t look like he’s going to see eye to eye with me on this. \n\nIn all honesty I don’t even know if I would be comfortable with them rekindling the relationship given the way she has treated me in the past and my gut feeling that there’s something slightly more to the friendship. I’m just lost and need advice as I can’t talk to anyone else about this. \n\n\nTL;DR I feel like my boyfriend still has feeling for his ex bestfriend (who he once had feelings for) because I’ve caught him numerous times going out of his way to check her socials","completion":"Lol. \n\nTry writing your own songs and sing poorly at her.

{"prompt":"I feel like my (26f) boyfriend (28m) still has feelings for his ex best friend I feel like my boyfriend still has feelings for his ex best friend\n\nMe (26f) and my boyfriend (28m) have been dating for four years. We have a great relationship usually and we are genuinely each others best friends. But before we began dating he had this girl best friend (27f), they were very close, used to hang out all the time, talk most days and would even share a bed if he stayed over at her place. He admitted to me that he had a crush on her but that she was not interested in him so nothing happened romantically between them.\n\n\nWhen we began dating I was keen to meet her but she was pretty rude towards me during our first interaction and showed no interest which completely threw me off. She would then proceed to invite my boyfriend to lunches and dinners or over to stay at her house and exclude me, which annoyed my boyfriend as he felt it was purposeful and unnecessarily mean of her, so he would try to include me in the plans which would then make her uninterested and the plan wouldn’t go ahead. If we ever were all together in a group setting she would make me feel highly uncomfortable and do things like be very overly touchy feely with him, behaving in a girlfriend-like manner. One time even grabbing his leg under the table and said “we never hang out just us anymore” giving him puppy dog eyes, to which my boyfriend replied to her saying that they can still hang out just with me now also. \n\nSo essentially this sort of behaviour went on for awhile and at this point it’s safe to say I did not like her at all. She failed to be the cool person I thought she might have been and ended up being the stereotypical “girl best friend”. She moved cities so we stopped hearing from her as much and I grateful that my boyfriend respected me and our relationship enough to put boundaries in place with her without me even having to ask.\n\nIt’s been at least 3 years since then and we haven’t heard from her, we only have her on socials so I know she’s in a long term relationship now. But about four months ago I noticed my boyfriend had been liking her selfies which isn’t a common occurrence. So I asked him about it, after some time he said that he’s missing the friendship and is just thinking about old times with her. I tried to be understanding toward him but I also wanted him to understand how that doesn’t particularly make me feel good about myself or secure in the relationship considering he has liked her as more than just a friend before. He said her posts just show up on his feed and that gets him thinking about the past so then he likes the selfie. The topic was then dropped, but I didn’t really feel reassured by him and truly felt maybe it was more than just a friendship he was mourning.\n\nSo then I did something that I probably shouldn’t have, I muted her account on his Instagram so that her posts would no longer show up in the main feed, so that he would stop always seeing what she’s doing and thinking of her so intensely. I know that doing that was a breach of privacy and I shouldn’t have done it in hindsight, but at the time I felt justified to do it as a way to try and halt what was happening and partly to see if he would still go out of his way to react to her posts and stories.  \n\nFast forward to yesterday, I was using his phone (we use each-others phones for things openly) and I saw there was messages on Instagram between them, nothing that interesting but he had messaged a response to something on her story, she gave a meek reply and eventually left his final message on seen. She seemed fairly disinterested in the convo. Then I check her profile and he’s liking her posts, which means he’s been going out of his way to check up on her, and judging from the story reply it seems he wanted a way to strike up a conversation. \n\nNow it’s really not the conversation or the liking of the posts that is getting to me it’s the lying and the going out of his way to constantly check up on this girl after all this time. I just have to wonder why. I mean, I have old guy best friends from my past that I miss from time to time and think of them fondly but I don’t do what my boyfriend is doing. I appreciate that we have all grown up and moved on with our lives, moved cities etc, and they all have long term relationships now and I respect that.\n\nSo, I confronted him and just told him that I’ve tried to be understanding of the situation but I feel like it’s more than a friendship feeling that he’s harbouring for her, and that it’s making me feel really sad. He became defensive and began to yell and said he only interacts with her because she comes up on his feed, so I admitted to him that I muted her and so he’s lying. \n\nBut now this whole topic of conversation has been derailed because he is now only focusing on the fact that I muted her without his knowledge. I know that was wrong of me to do and I have been apologetic toward him for that, but I also feel like he’s now using this as a scapegoat to get out of explaining himself and his feelings toward her (which he claims is non-romantic) so he’s not addressing it properly at all.\n\nI don’t know where to go from here. He’s saying that he had to drop her from his life because of me, which annoys me that he’s putting that blame entirely on me when I was the one who was excited to met her in the beginning and she didn’t want a bar of it.

{"prompt":"Should I 19f have returned my car because 23m boyfriend said to? I’m going to apologize in advance for how this might be formatted for I’m writing this on my phone. Sorry if it’s not perfect. \n\nI (19f) have a boyfriend (23m) who I’ve been dating for almost 7 months. For some backstory things have been off recently between us because we haven’t had much time for ourselves or each other due to us both working a lot. So this past weekend he asked for space to recharge and I gladly gave him it because honestly I needed it too.\n\nSo we took about two days to ourselves and during that time I bought a new car. It was something I was planning on doing anyways and i told him that previously the only thing I didn’t tell him was my plan changed. I was originally going to finance with my sister but things changed and I financed by myself which made my interest rate and car payment higher  because right now I have little credit and am a first time buyer\n\nNonetheless I still was very proud of myself. I was so excited about it but I didn’t tell him because we were taking some time to ourselves so I was planning on telling him later. I was so excited about my car I posted it on my snap story not thinking about it and forgetting he could see it. The next day rolls around and he texts me asking if I got a car and I told him I did. We talked for a bit then he started asking me what I thought were innocent questions.\n\n Such as “how much is the loan?” Or “what’s your payment like?”. I answered and at first he was supportive until he started asking more. Now again this car is my first car I bought by myself. My interest rate is really high and so is my car payment but I can refinance in six months and drop it by $200 and it’s a good way for me to earn credit considering I have no other major bills right now. Also the car I was in before was on its last legs. It was a 2009 Saturn and it was old and beat up.\n\n It maybe would’ve lasted me a few more months before I ended up on the side of the road. I tried to explain to him this but he starts to call me impulsive. Saying I shouldn’t have bought my car so impulsively and I should return it. He also started saying he was just trying to pass on the advice he got from his mom when he was my age and made impulsive decisions as well.\n\n This really bothered me. It hurt to think he thought I did this impulsively when I don’t think I did. With the way he worded everything he made me feel stupid as well. I expressed this and he continued to say he’s sorry for making me feel stupid but he is trying to teach me a lesson in finance. He is trying to protect me. \n\nHe goes on to tell me I went to a shitty dealership and is upset that I didn’t run my decision by him. He is upset I didn’t tell him what I was doing. This confused me because In no way are our finances tied. I don’t see why he is so upset because I’m my eyes this doesn’t affect him at all. I then told him I just wanted his support and not to be ridiculed and he proceeded to tell me he can’t fake support. \n\nIt’s almost been a week now and we haven’t talked since we fought last weekend. This has left me confused and upset because I thought I was doing the right thing. I also didn’t go alone I went with my mom to the dealership who helped me through the whole process and helped me make a plan. I can understand how he’d be upset that I didn’t tell him about it earlier but I don’t think it’s a decision I need to “run by him”. But should I have returned the car? \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend and I fought about me getting a new car. He called me impulsive and said I should return it and he can’t support my decision. Our finances aren’t tied so none of this affects him. We haven’t talked for a week now. Should I have returned it?","completion":"It’s mostly up to your Dad and Mom. Are they willing to meet her?

{"prompt":"I(21m) have been torn apart by the actions of my girlfriend(29f) My girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me anymore. She doesn't even want me in the same car as her. I asked her to take me to the bank so I could take 60 dollars out and she seemed reluctant. During the whole car ride it felt like I was talking to myself and she would answer in an annoyed tone. It first started about a week after moving into WA. She started with just not being in the mood to speak and getting annoyed when I would try to lighten up her mood. She would ignore me and only speak when her cousin or my godmother spoke to her. After realizing that I asked her why she ignores me but only speaks to her cousin and my godmother. She asked me in an annoyed tone if I was jealous of both of them. I said no because it wasn't anything like that I was only hurt. She proceeds to say that she was also ignoring her cousin but her cousin will match the attitude and things will escalate. So I chose to stay out of her way. And only speak when I see that she is not in a mood. It's been a whole month and she has been the same way. About a week ago I found out she is thinking of ending things and moving out. I don't know what to do. She doesn't speak to me unless we are in front of my godmother. She seems tired of me. I don't know what I did. My godmother told me my GF wants space so I gave her space. It seems like giving her space came back to bite me in the ass. She doesn't seem to care about me anymore. She disappeared 2 days in a row. She dropped my stepkids to school and didn't come back the whole day while my godparents were gone. She never responded to me asking where she was. She only told me where she was when she came back. She said she was at her aunties house and that I had no reason to be worried because in the end she has her kids and they will be fine.(her kids were at school). I don't know what to do. I want to end things but I don't know how. This is my first relationship after 4 years. My previous relationship ended because my GF thought I was cheating on her with my cousin and didn't believe that I was related to her. So I got up and just left.

She doesn't seem to want to be with me anymore. My godmother noticed everything and has been speaking with her. My godmother asked her if she still cares about me and she said she doesn't know anymore. I want this relationship to last because before things got to this point our life together was great. Our sex life was great. We made each other happy by just speaking to each other and now it seems like she doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't know what to do.

Those aren’t your “step kids”.  You probably shouldn’t have even met them yet, but that’s her decision on who she brings in and out of the their lives I guess.  To add to that, y’all are living together already?!  With the kids?  Nope, too soon.  But again, that’s my opinion.  The age difference, while I know you’re both legal adults, is pretty significant.  She’s almost 30 and you’re just out of your teenage years.  I’m not even going to touch on all the other family members who seem to be involved in this.  Just get out."}

It bugs me a little.   Not everyone has a support system where they can easily drop the kids off while they go out on dates.  Sometimes you have to introduce them to your kids earlier than you want to due to circumstances.  There's really no set amount of time to wait for it to be acceptable to introduce your kids to your new boyfriend. \n\nYou are right though that after only 5 months they shouldn't be calling him step-dad.  My kids call my boyfriend by his name and it's been almost 6 years together.  They do reference him as their step-dad, but really only after we moved in with him.   You introduce them as \"a friend\" though, not \"here's your new step-daddy.\"  \n\nWe don't know if that's how it went down.  It's a little ambiguous how OP phrased it, so we don't really know if they were together before he met the kids and how long that was.  He clearly bonded with them in the 5 months he's known the kids."}

If it's barely been a few days, then it's possible that she's still in that awkward phase after rejecting someone. The drunk text may not have been offensive, but it still might have weirded her out since she didn't want a relationship, said so, and then you texted her this second confession. You may need to give it some time. My suggestion is just to say \"Hi\" when you walk past and nothing else. Don't follow her, don't say anything else, don't get defensive, and don't try to bring up the text. Just \"Hi\". Sometimes a simple friendly hello can break the barrier. If she doesn't want to speak to you any further, then you'll know.\n\nIf she doesn't speak to you again, then sadly it just wasn't meant to be. For one reason or another, that text threw her off or she didn't like the confession. It would be best to leave it at that. and try to find new friends."}

Gotta find a way to take back the power dynamic without sacrificing someone motivated to work (at least I assume he is as it sounds like he is just being too ambitious without realizing he has crossed the line for his given position in the company). This is easier said than done unfortunately and each case is unique.. but there are some general approaches. \n\n2a. Make everything so transparent that when he fucks it is impossible for him to not confront his own mistake. \n\n2b. Find a way to show him that you can do his job better and quicker in a non-threatening way so he garners more respect for you. (But of course, don't make it obvious lol)\n\n2c. Move him between different tasks as much as possible. Keeping him busy reorienting to new tasks constantly will keep his focus on his work and not his ego and train him to be a better multitasker."}

Another redditor was given a few awards above for some amazing insight that’s now my guess to the culprit, too. I think you two can work things out if you’re able to be a bit more independent from him by way of a different caretaker. This will hopefully allow the two of you to get back closer to where you were headed in the first place. I know that takes money, though, and anything involving your health is going to be expensive af, unfortunately. \n\nI’m so sorry for what you’re going through. You didn’t ask for this and had no way to know about it. It’s terrifying to deal with something that threatens your health, especially at a younger age. I don’t have real advice here but I DO know a bit about what you’re going through. I was diagnosed with cancer at 32 and it has been a nightmare ever since. (I pray you’re potentially not American so you can at least survive the debt.) My bf and I had been together longer than you and yours but going through surgery/treatment/recovery still made every single thing about what was an already bad relationship that much worse. I can’t imagine how damaging it would be to a healthy one, even in subtle ways, where you don’t know one another as well just yet. I hope that the two of you are able to find your way back and I hope that your health improves ASAP. Feeling crappy while already feeling crappy is painful and unpleasant."}

By the time I was a teenager and they were recovered from most of their problems and making more money, they decided to spoil the two youngest by providing them with everything that myself and my middle sibling never really got. Meanwhile, they still made the two of us work to provide for ourselves anything extra that wasn’t the essentials (they bought food, put a roof over our head, etc but if we wanted clothes or dresses for school dances or anything that wasn’t deemed essential, we were told to earn the money ourselves). This wouldn’t be so bad necessarily if not for the fact that at the same time we watched them buy the two youngest expensive laptops, clothes, and anything they wanted.

My husband is an architect. We have been doing well for ourselves up until last year when his contract ended with one job and his next contract wasn’t starting for about 6 months.

My parents have been doing really well the last several years - like owning multiple properties and retiring early well- I really didn’t want to ask them because of our past but my husbands family has no money and could not help even if they wanted to, so I ended up asking my parents to borrow some money. They agreed and said not to worry and to pay them back whenever we could, which I was shocked about because they never used to lend me anything and if I ever asked it was made into a huge deal and they would make me feel like sh** for even asking.

You do not talk to them. You do not respond. As soon as you are able, you send them the money you owe them, and then you continue not talking to them.\n\nFor the money: from your post, it doesn't sound like you've got a budget or a real plan for repaying them. You and your husband need a budget. Sit down and look at where your money has been going for the past few months and break it all down. List your monthly take-home income and what it has been spent on. Then post the details in /r/personalfinance and ask them for their advice in clearing this $6k debt."}

My parents have been doing really well the last several years - like owning multiple properties and retiring early well- I really didn’t want to ask them because of our past but my husbands family has no money and could not help even if they wanted to, so I ended up asking my parents to borrow some money. They agreed and said not to worry and to pay them back whenever we could, which I was shocked about because they never used to lend me anything and if I ever asked it was made into a huge deal and they would make me feel like sh** for even asking.

My parents wanted me to fly to their home to basically dog sit while they took a 3 month world tour vacation. I told them I cannot take that time off work, to which my mom immediately threw in my face the money we owe them and started to demand I pay them back immediately.

I think the issue is that my husband and I were still recovering from the 6 months of having no income and are only now getting to a place where we can start making payments to them. We hadn’t been in any rush previously because they had initially told us to pay them back “when we can” and only started holding it over my head when I couldn’t do things they asked of me. \n\nI appreciate your advice on the budget and will begin figuring that out. \n\nMy intention in bringing up all the money they spent on my siblings without expecting anything in return isn’t to say I feel I shouldn’t have to pay them back, but rather just venting resentment I feel I suppose."}

My husband is an architect. We have been doing well for ourselves up until last year when his contract ended with one job and his next contract wasn’t starting for about 6 months. We had a savings but I was finishing my masters and not working at the time so we were running out of money. My parents have been doing really well the last several years - like owning multiple properties and retiring early well- I really didn’t want to ask them because of our past but my husbands family has no money and could not help even if they wanted to, so I ended up asking my parents to borrow some money. They agreed and said not to worry and to pay them back whenever we could, which I was shocked about because they never used to lend me anything and if I ever asked it was made into a huge deal and they would make me feel like sh** for even asking. I thought maybe things had changed. \n\nThat is until about a year later, we are still struggling to catch up from those 6 months of no income. My parents wanted me to fly to their home to basically dog sit while they took a 3 month world tour vacation. I told them I cannot take that time off work, to which my mom immediately threw in my face the money we owe them and started to demand I pay them back immediately. Now I’m being told that by not paying them back the 6000 we borrowed (yes, I know it’s a lot) that we are essentially ruining their plans of early retirement. \n\nI don’t know what to do because we just don’t have it yet. I also don’t understand why they have always had no problem paying everything for my youngest siblings (including 25,000 for one of their weddings and a deposit for one of their houses with no expectation of being paid back). \n\nI don’t feel like I’m entitled to their money and to be honest I wish more than anything that I could just give it all back to them right now but this whole things makes me feel like I never want to talk to them again… but then I feel guilty and like I’m being an entitled jerk. \n\nAny advice appreciated, even if it’s against me. I’d truly like an outside perspective. \n\nTL;DR parents paid for everything for youngest siblings but nothing for me and middle child, now holding money my husband and I borrowed from them a year ago over our heads.","completion":"Time to cancel your boyfriend plans.

He has trained 10 students to black before me, all stopped practicing or just stopped after reaching black 1st grade. I'm not the best student but I learnt a lot. My sensei has guided me a lot.

My sensei has called my grandmaster to give a demo and explain what karathe is. By the end my sensei advised that I won't be able to handle and he would take the class over and if the student head count increased we would split and take the class. I didn't think much as I was passionate and i just followed what my elder said. In the mean time I would be responsible for his class where I learnt karathe (this class was handed over to my sensei from grandmaster. Total students were around 4 when I took over teaching). The students were around 30 from my community all children around 5 to 12 years old. There was this guy(21M) Mike (name changed) was interested, but was afraid he would be judged. So my sensei asked him to join his main class which I took care of. I was the one who taught his all the basics from beginner to advanced (white belt to blue belt). After which he was asked to join the class in our community. \nThe head count was in the class I took care of reduced to 1(me), it made me question myself. But it was due to my sensei asking them to stop as they were irregular. So I was asked to join the class in my community. I became close to Mike. In this mean time my sensei got married and moved to a different home, which made it difficult for him to take class. He asked grandmaster (his dad) to take over the class. My grandmaster with his  2 students(call them Z &amp; Q) took over class from my sensei. The seniority in our is my grandmaster at top and then his son (my sensei). The 1 students ofy grandmaster were junior to me. Even I have thaught them. My sensei had another student let's call him Adam(name changed) who had a seperate class. Adam joined stating he was got black from another master and he joined under our organisation as senior to me by belt grading but in the eyes of my sensei I am the senior. I was in charge of taking the belt grading of my sensei class and Adam's class.\n\nMy sensei started playing mobile game with Mike. I too joined them but I was more like a pc gamer, I was tired of the game which they were playing. My sensei planned to watch a movie whic included Mike, Mike's friend and myself. We had a great time. The class went as usual.  Then came my medical issue. After a month or two I joined them back but not physically best in condition. After a few months I got hospitalized for 3 weeks. Took some time but still came back. Even now I not as good as before but I can handle myself. Since I became close with mike and knew he was playing game with my sensei regularly. I kept in the loop about my health and asked him to share it with sensei. Later I came to know that he didn't share the full info. \n\nRecently Z &amp; Q planned a movie night with mike, the lefte out. My sensei wife has planned a dinner outing with mike. I'm thinking that mike has be leaving me out. I want to speak about this to my sensei but I feel like I might portray myself entitled. It came to my know mike has started to take new class in a different gated community, note that mike has yet to graduate to black belt. I feel like I have been left out and feeling abandoned. I highly respect my sensei. But lately I feel like that have been taking advantage of me. The students fee from my community is enough to sustain one famil. My parents have been saying that it doesn't look got that my sensei took over the class which I suggested. I too have some truma. I can't afford therapy as I'm living with my parents. I haven't taken my life for granted but I've been living a luxury life. I don't know what to do.","completion":"I think he is a dick for not saying anything about wanting the time to himself before you got the hotel or at least giving you money back because he ditched your plans. \n\nI can understand him wanting time to do other things he enjoys though.

The students were around 30 from my community all children around 5 to 12 years old. There was this guy(21M) Mike (name changed) was interested, but was afraid he would be judged. So my sensei asked him to join his main class which I took care of. I was the one who taught his all the basics from beginner to advanced (white belt to blue belt). After which he was asked to join the class in our community. \nThe head count was in the class I took care of reduced to 1(me), it made me question myself. But it was due to my sensei asking them to stop as they were irregular. So I was asked to join the class in my community. I became close to Mike. In this mean time my sensei got married and moved to a different home, which made it difficult for him to take class. He asked grandmaster (his dad) to take over the class. My grandmaster with his  2 students(call them Z &amp; Q) took over class from my sensei. The seniority in our is my grandmaster at top and then his son (my sensei). The 1 students ofy grandmaster were junior to me. Even I have thaught them. My sensei had another student let's call him Adam(name changed) who had a seperate class. Adam joined stating he was got black from another master and he joined under our organisation as senior to me by belt grading but in the eyes of my sensei I am the senior. I was in charge of taking the belt grading of my sensei class and Adam's class.\n\nMy sensei started playing mobile game with Mike. I too joined them but I was more like a pc gamer, I was tired of the game which they were playing. My sensei planned to watch a movie whic included Mike, Mike's friend and myself. We had a great time. The class went as usual.  Then came my medical issue. After a month or two I joined them back but not physically best in condition. After a few months I got hospitalized for 3 weeks. Took some time but still came back. Even now I not as good as before but I can handle myself. Since I became close with mike and knew he was playing game with my sensei regularly. I kept in the loop about my health and asked him to share it with sensei. Later I came to know that he didn't share the full info. \n\nRecently Z &amp; Q planned a movie night with mike, the lefte out. My sensei wife has planned a dinner outing with mike. I'm thinking that mike has be leaving me out. I want to speak about this to my sensei but I feel like I might portray myself entitled. It came to my know mike has started to take new class in a different gated community, note that mike has yet to graduate to black belt. I feel like I have been left out and feeling abandoned. I highly respect my sensei. But lately I feel like that have been taking advantage of me. The students fee from my community is enough to sustain one famil. My parents have been saying that it doesn't look got that my sensei took over the class which I suggested. I too have some truma. I can't afford therapy as I'm living with my parents. I haven't taken my life for granted but I've been living a luxury life. I don't know what to do.","completion":"I’ve tried finding someone irl to date, but no one has even come remotely close to as pretty as her."}

{"prompt":"I (M 32) am still bothered by this from my GF (F 30). Is it cheating? Is it Cheating? How Upset Should I be?\n\nThis happened a while back. I (32M) have been in a long distance relationship with my GF (30F) for a bit over a year and she’s going to move to me in 3 months.\n\nEvery now and then this still bothers me though and I’d like to get different perspectives.\nI can’t say that it will really change anything for me. I’m not going to break up with her. But I want to know if I was totally out of line or if I should have been even more upset.\n\nWhen I first reconnected with her (I knew her and dated her when we were teens) she told me of a guy that was pursuing her but she wasn’t quite feeling him. As time went on I learned more.\nShe had been friends with him for a while and they had mutual friends. During the pandemic she stated she got real down with the limited human interaction and he was the one person he would let in her apartment. They would get together to watch scary movies every so often. They would sleep in bed together. They would cuddle. They would spoon. She states that nothing more ever happened. They never kissed. Never had sex. Never were nice together. Never touched each other sexually. One night though when he was the big spoon he according to her, out of nowhere and súper out of place, asked her if he “could put it in.” She responded no. He was a bit drunk and they went to sleep.\n\nWhen we started talking it had been about a month and a half since they had gotten together and she claims she never again did after we started talking. She would text him pretty regularly though although she now claims she never did. I made my Snapchat to talk to her, since she liked it. She was my only friend on there for months and only recently did her sister add me and the both of them are my only friends. When it was just her, for months he was top of my quick add recommendations. He went down almost immediately after I finally got through to her about reducing the talking with him so I know there’s a tie-in.\n\nWe had reasons to not go public on our relationship for some time. When we first started dating she would send pictures of the food that she would get while out with me to him. Apparently this was something they did often and one time she said “sorry […] it means something to him for some reason.” That’s a phrase that really bugs me to this day and I’ve never told her. I’ve otherwise fully communicated my feelings to her though and don’t want to Best a dead horse.\n\nFor a long time she said she didn’t tell him she had a bf, even when he invited her to the movies to watch X….\nShe didn’t go.\nShe didn’t tell him when he I asked her when they would hang out and she answered she had been very busy lately. I was in town at the time for a two week trip with her. He responded to her “since when don’t you have time for me?” This also really burns me up. \n\nI had to bring it up several times that it bothered me and she wouldn’t accept that I had any reason to be bothered until one day I wrote her this super long text, basically an essay, explaining why I felt it was wrong and felt disrespected. Even then I didn’t tell her to stop talking to him. I basically told her i don’t feel right that she knows she’d be willing to have sex with her and still considers him a friend. I told her in the same shoes if I was talking to a girl that lived in town with me that I had the same history with there’s no way anybody would feel right about it. I only asked her to tell him she had a bf. She two days later told me she had and I saw an immediate drop in her texts with him when we visit, he dropped on my quick adds, she doesn’t mention him anymore.

{"prompt":"I (M 32) am still bothered by this from my GF (F 30). Is it cheating? Is it Cheating? How Upset Should I be?\n\nThis happened a while back. I (32M) have been in a long distance relationship with my GF (30F) for a bit over a year and she’s going to move to me in 3 months.\n\nEvery now and then this still bothers me though and I’d like to get different perspectives.\nI can’t say that it will really change anything for me. I’m not going to break up with her. But I want to know if I was totally out of line or if I should have been even more upset.\n\nWhen I first reconnected with her (I knew her and dated her when we were teens) she told me of a guy that was pursuing her but she wasn’t quite feeling him. As time went on I learned more.\nShe had been friends with him for a while and they had mutual friends. During the pandemic she stated she got real down with the limited human interaction and he was the one person he would let in her apartment. They would get together to watch scary movies every so often. They would sleep in bed together. They would cuddle. They would spoon. She states that nothing more ever happened. They never kissed. Never had sex. Never were nice together. Never touched each other sexually. One night though when he was the big spoon he according to her, out of nowhere and súper out of place, asked her if he “could put it in.” She responded no. He was a bit drunk and they went to sleep.\n\nWhen we started talking it had been about a month and a half since they had gotten together and she claims she never again did after we started talking. She would text him pretty regularly though although she now claims she never did. I made my Snapchat to talk to her, since she liked it. She was my only friend on there for months and only recently did her sister add me and the both of them are my only friends. When it was just her, for months he was top of my quick add recommendations. He went down almost immediately after I finally got through to her about reducing the talking with him so I know there’s a tie-in.\n\nWe had reasons to not go public on our relationship for some time. When we first started dating she would send pictures of the food that she would get while out with me to him. Apparently this was something they did often and one time she said “sorry […] it means something to him for some reason.” That’s a phrase that really bugs me to this day and I’ve never told her. I’ve otherwise fully communicated my feelings to her though and don’t want to Best a dead horse.\n\nFor a long time she said she didn’t tell him she had a bf, even when he invited her to the movies to watch X….\nShe didn’t go.\nShe didn’t tell him when he I asked her when they would hang out and she answered she had been very busy lately. I was in town at the time for a two week trip with her. He responded to her “since when don’t you have time for me?” This also really burns me up. \n\nI had to bring it up several times that it bothered me and she wouldn’t accept that I had any reason to be bothered until one day I wrote her this super long text, basically an essay, explaining why I felt it was wrong and felt disrespected.

{"prompt":"I (28F) am depressed and keep fighting with my partner (34M) until it gets really nasty. I moved to my partner's home country, north of Europe and I am from the South of Europe, where the sun shines every day.  The transition, lack of sun, and being far from family and friends has gotten to me pretty badly. I also started working a job that I hate but just to get by, anyway, I am trying my best, at least I feel like I am. The problem is that I don't feel like I can complain to my boyfriend about how I am feeling because it hurts him and it ends up in a fight most of the time. He likes to point out that he moved far from home years ago when he went to Uni, whereas I don't feel like it is a fair comparison because uni gives you instant friends and connections unlike just moving with a partner.\n\nFast forward to today and I had a pregnancy scare, in the morning I woke up and my partner started talking about how he read that a women's vagina goes back to normal after one kid bla bla and I really wasn't up for this topic as my anxiety is through the roof. I called him out on it and we didn't speak until later. I tested and found out I am not pregnant. Lashed out at my boyfriend for various reasons and it ended up in me saying that I don't want to ever have a child with him.\n\nI feel really bad about it.

(We both dated each others best friends). \n\nHonestly, I think that they already know, but it’s one of those unspoken things that neither of us are choosing to address. We have had a few moments recently that have maybe intensified my already existing feelings, feelings that maybe have existed for years. But i’ve always suppressed them. Mostly because they were in a relationship when we first met. And I entered a relationship soon after. And the significant others of both of those relationships ended up becoming our best friends. (Their ex-partner is my current best friend/ vice versa.) I am terrified to hurt my best friend. \n\nNow however, my internal conflict is, is I feel as though they definitely know, or at least suspect. And if so, they seem to be trying to pursue something with everyone else expect me. Which is fine, it’s not like i’m doing anything about it either. I don’t know what to do about it. I could just let it go. But I can’t help but feel like there’s something more. They’re already my best friend, and we are crossing “friend” boundaries as time passes. Expect i’m beginning to feel uncomfortable that we are, because we don’t address it. I’m not very good at setting personal boundaries, which is terrible. But I just was never taught, nor do I know how to. I just can’t think of another person who I enjoy to spend my time with any more than them, so I let myself slip away in the moments. But maybe i’m disrespecting myself by doing so and not setting any boundary- which I don’t even know what that would be. I’m definitely super emotional at the moment and overthinking a lot of internal things at the moment. Just in my head. \n\nBut now I feel as though I have a time limit to either openly express my feelings or keep it within. They are leaving the country for a few months in about 45 days. Not sure if they’ll come back. Most likely but there’s a chance they won’t. \n\nWhat should I do? \n\nI know I could be treated better regardless, but I can’t help the way I feel about this person.","completion":"💜"}

{"prompt":"Should I [21f] tell my boyfriend [22m] My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. I’ve never loved someone as much as I’ve loved this man. He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I didn’t flirt back until having messaged him. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. \n\nMy therapist said that this sounds like a normal teenage thing to do and that I need to learn to control my obsessive thoughts but I feel like this is different. I feel like if I don’t tell him then I’m keeping it a secret. We’ve been dating now for 4 years and I feel like I owe him the honesty. Everyone else has told me to move past it, and that telling him would just hurt his feelings and maybe even make him question me for still thinking about it 4 years later. I haven’t thought of it until this last month but now that I have remembered it, I can’t stop thinking about it. \n\nDo I tell him for honesty sake or do I keep it to myself? Should I feel as shitty as I do or was this just a mistake in my past? Everyone is telling me the opposite of what my brain is feeling.","completion":"Please update us when you speak to Olivia"}

{"prompt":"Me (19 F and my boyfriend (22 M) might break up and I don't know what to do. Hi guys. Just as the title says, me (19f) and my boyfriend (22m) are very close to breaking up. we met in the middle of the pandemic 2.5 years ago on league of legends (yes..) started talking on discord and eventually we were in a platonic relationship. 4 months later we had our first date and it went horribly because things were awkward, but decided to still be friends because we were very close already, had similar interests and liked being around each other. We started going out more, I introduced him to my friend group and they all liked him very fast. By the end of 2021 we were best friends already (hang out almost everyday, played games together, sleepovers, etc.), we basically knew everything and anything about each other. This continued on till the end of 2022, where on December 25th (yes xmas day) he ended up confessing to me. Obviously we talked it out before everything started and we knew that we cant go back to how it was before. We still continued to do stuff like before and some more and it was pretty nice. Sometimes arguments happened but we always figured it out. A week ago he said something that I really didn't like and instead of talking to him about it normally I lashed out to him (yelling, crying),I do that a lot of times when I don't like something (and don't get me wrong, I know it's bad to react like this --not only in a romantic relationship but every kind of relationship--) and I apologized. He didn't like my reaction and this has happened once before already but he didn't mention anything. Last night we talked about it and he said he doesn't know what he wants yet and that I should wait a little bit, but it is most likely that we will break up. If we actually break up I already know I will be very empty for a while. I know it kinda goes the same for him too. I know \"I'm too young\" to worry about stuff like this and I have a lot to learn and so on but I really don't want to lose him. He means a lot to me and I love him, not as my boyfriend but as a person, he's always been there.

This is the person that gave you life. Your reaction to your GF is VERY understandable. You both are at the point where you’re in a serious relationship. Life only gets harder and you will experience more loss. Unfortunately that’s how life works the older we get. If your partner is oblivious to your feelings it’s going to create even more issues down the road. It may also lead to a lot of resentment on your part. Think about if she lost a parent? Would she react the same way how she did about your mom’s passing? Or would her loss be more important than yours? If that’s the case, will you feel resentment towards her? If marriage and children is some thing you hope for in the future there are so many other things that may happen throughout your life and you’re going to need your partner to be there as your teammate and to support you through it. In my opinion, a relationship is nothing if there is not trust, support, and loyalty."}

We were genuinely just friends until last October, when he started developing feelings for me.\n\nL confessed to me last Christmas, and after days of thinking, I said yes to him.

{"prompt":"My(18f) boyfriend(18m) told his best friend(19f) about our private life and now I don’t know if I can trust him. \nFor the most part, this is just a long vent.\n\nSome back story, my(18f) boyfriend(18m), let’s call him jack, and I have been together for almost a year, prior to this everything was great between us. He has a best friend, lets call her Bella(19f), who he’s known for about as long as he’s known me. I’ve heard from him and a couple other people that’s they used to have feelings for each other, but have apparently gotten over them.\n\nI just found out that my boyfriend had told Bella about our romantic life, like bedroom stuff. This is something he knows I’m sensitive about and he’s the only person I’ve felt comfortable enough to be sexual with. Apparently he told her a couple months ago when they were hanging out together, he didn’t ask me if he could. This was around the time he and I started getting serious. He told her everything I’m into, and I’m not extremely kinky but I do have some tame kinks. The way I found out that she knows is she thought that it would be ok to come up to me and tell me that she “can relate to most of them.” I asked her why she knew about those things as I had never brought them up to her or anyone else for that matter. She told me straight up that my boyfriend told her. I immediately confronted him about it and he told me something along the lines of he barely remembers telling her and he was just making jokes about it. At this point I didn’t even know how to feel, I was hurt and angry and I felt so violated. He eventually realized just how upset he made me and he apologized multiple times. I initially tried to forgive him but now something isn’t sitting right with me. He has told me multiple times that he sees Bella as a sister, but I would never walk up to my sibling and tell them what my partner likes in bed, or share my own kinks. Bella’s ex is my and my boyfriend’s friend still, let’s call him Jay. Jay and my boyfriend used to be best friends before Jay met Bella when she started dating Jay. Even when jay and Bella were together she would hang out with jack way more than her partner (this was before me and jack were together). This never bothered me until recently.  It was never my intention to make him stop being friends with her or anything like that. However, I’m becoming suspicious about their relationship. Earlier this week, I found a hair on his hoodie. It wasn’t mine, it was short, blonde, and had some loose curl to it, even when I stretched it out it stayed curled. I asked him about it. The conversation went like this:\nMe- “What’s this?”\nHim- “Oh I’ve been finding those on me all day, I think it’s my mom’s.”\nMe- “Ok, I love you.”\nI walked off after that because I was running late and needed to get moving. Yes, his mom had been around his laundry because he still lives with her for the time being. But his moms hair is long and straight. His sister’s hair is short and straight. They’re both blonde, but his sister has teal hi-lights in her hair. Bella, on the other hand, has short blonde hair that curls at the top. I had been around him a lot that day and not found any hairs on him at all until then. He started blowing up my phone after I left being defensive and swearing he was innocent. He kept talking about how it hurt that nobody trusted him, about how he would never do that, etc. I never accused him of anything. Normally I wouldn’t have questioned it, I love him and he’s never given me a reason not to trust him before sharing my personal things. He’s noticeably happier around her, he comforts her a lot when she’s sad or stressed. Where as if he has to comfort me for too long he starts to make it about him and I always end up comforting him. It’s not that he’s comforting her it’s that he’s doing more for her. All of this has been in my head for weeks, I don’t even want to get sexual with him anymore, I’m hurt and confused. I don’t want to end the relationship over something stupid. I’ve never been bothered by their friendship, I want to trust him but I don’t know anymore. He’s always been a sexual person, but now it just seems weird. I’m leaving out a lot of evidence that confirms my suspicion because it’s extremely complex and I’m very tired while writing this.\n\nAm I crazy? It all feels really suspicious to me. I feel like I’m overreacting and overthinking everything and if I need a reality check please someone tell me.

{"prompt":"Fwb(26M) cried about losing me(21F) I met my FWB on tinder a couple of months ago. Every week he’d drive to my house and spend time with me and we wouldn’t always have sex. He’d be super affectionate and cuddle me for hours without letting go and kiss my face etc. Day two of meeting him he said he doesn’t want a relationship primarily bc he has seizures and his life is complicated because of that. Every week we’d spend more and more time together consisting of him driving to me even though it’s not safe for him to drive. \n\nA week ago he went on a trip to a nearby city and contracted herpes (not sure which type) from having sec with someone else. The week he returned he texting me saying he really wants to come see me but is sick. I found out at the end of the week that he just didn’t want to see me bc he didn’t have all of the information about the situation yet and didn’t know how to tell me. I told him that I don’t know if I can keep seeing him bc he lied to me, and that’s the only thing I hate. I feel like he went out of his way to form a lie when he could have never texted saying he wants to see me but can’t bc he’s sick or could have just told me the situation right out.\n\nHe said he was afraid of how I’d react even though I’m super calm all of the time. He didn’t know how to bring it up. He cried when I said I’m going to have to decide whether or not I want to continue seeing him. \n\nI can’t decide what to do in this situation. Part of me wants to cut him off bc my one rule was to not lie to me. I really enjoy all of the time we’ve spent together but him lying to me triggers me. I don’t know if I’m over reacting. Know he’s begging me not to remove him from my life. How do I go about this?\n\nTLDR: \nFWB (26M) and I (22F) have gotten really close in the past four months. We’ve been very affectionate and seeing each other around four times a week not always having sex but sometimes just cuddling. He went on a trip, contracted herpes (not sure which type) and when he came back he randomly texted me saying he wants to see me but can’t bc he’s sick. I he told me five days later what the truth was in person. He lied about being sick bc he wasn’t sure how to tell me about his test results. I told him I’m not sure I will keep him in my life bc my only rule was to not lie to me. He cried and is begging me to let him stay in my life. I understand that he lied bc he was scared but my previous trauma tells me I should have 0 tolerance. I want to keep seeing him bc I’ve enjoyed every moment with him but it sucks that he lied. \n\nWhy did he cry and what should I do?","completion":"It’s actually really common for people to get horrifyingly sick when they catch herpes, and they don’t find out that’s what causing it until they go in and get tested. If he was lying about being sick he may have been lying about when he contracted it; he could have had it for years and decided to finally tell you about it now but chose to do so in a way that would make it seem like he hadn’t been lying to you about it all this time."}

{"prompt":"Difficult situation 32m-32f So a friend of mine who I’ve had feelings for kissed me the other night went I went to go visit her at work. She’s married. Her and her husband have been having marital problems for sometime now. He physically and mentally abusive and tries to isolate her. This is the first time I’ve seen her in months because of her husband. I was just coming to check in and see how everything was going. I was sitting in my vehicle waiting for the frost to thaw and I see her walking across the lot to my vehicle. She walks up to my window and gives me a hug. So I ask her are you ok? I get out and she grabs me and hugs me so tight. I’m in shock because it’s not a normal thing for her to do. She looks up at me as I’m in disbelief and we kiss. I put my head up hug her firmly and say take care of your self. The next evening she messaged me out of the blue on Facebook. Asks me to text her, so I did. At first she apologized for kissing me and saying that it was wrong for her to do so. I asked her what that was all about. And she spills everything. She tells me she’s not happy with her husband, she wants to be with me and has been wanting to for a long time. She tells me that when we embraced she’s never felt that way before. I know we have chemistry together. Our relationship has always been platonic. So this is a very interesting and confusing situation for me. As I’m sure it is for her. So we spent the day sending messages back and forth talking about what she wants to do. I tell her if she wants my help I will help her anyway I can because I just want her to be happy. \n\nAny advice for me on how to go forward with this would be greatly appreciated. \n\nExtra info we both have kids. We’re 32, known each other for 17 years and her husband is 28 I think.","completion":"Why is it your boyfriend’s responsibility to organise your transport for you? \n\nIf he has to pay for your Ubers from work why don’t you just ask him to pay off your debt and buy you a car?"}

That being said, i feel like I am on my death bed pretty much every second of the day despite my efforts to fix this. On top of that, I work full time as well as keep the house in order. my boyfriend also works full time. Both of us agreed we cannot have a baby right now due to personal reasons. It’s still a very hard decision but for the sake of the baby and us, it is best that we don’t.\n\ndue to recent events outside of the pregnancy, he has been under some stress but i have been doing what i can to shut off baby, pregnancy emotions to support him. \n\nToday, i was just feeling awful. I couldn’t stay awake for more than an hour, couldn’t eat bc i was too tired to eat but was constantly hungry and I haven’t been feeling super pretty. the whole night he was complimenting other girls on the tv and online. which usually wouldn’t be an issue, we do this together lol. but i felt so i blah bc lately he hasn’t been complimenting me as much on top of me already feeling like shit about myself. He asked me what was wrong and I told him how I was feeling. All i got was a half assed “oh you’re pretty” w a sigh.  that’s not what i wanted at all, i wanted him just next to me, and soften up a little. he didn’t even have to say anything but he was acting like this was the biggest burden in the world. this obviously hurt my feelings. I told him calmly, that wasn’t really wanted. it’s kinda like asking for flowers and getting them but it’s not the same bc you asked. \n\nThen, he was like well i’m sorry and walked away. I then sent him a text from the other room that read “i get you have stuff going on but so do i and i shut my stuff off to be there for you and talk to you yesterday. i’m trying to open up to you and all you’re doing is shutting me out. it’s like you ask me how i am but then my answer just doesn’t really matter. makes me feel like shit.” then he told me he was going out for a drink and didn’t even address my text after ik he read it. \n\nHe could tell this didn’t make me happy and stayed but was breathing heavy like “UGH” over everything.telling me how annoying I am, and was saying “i said you’re pretty what else do you want” stuff like that. even though i repeatedly told him what i needed. then i go on his twitter and he’s liking pictures of ass since the conversation we just had. i confronted him and he told me he just wasn’t “emotionally there today to take care of me”. which translated to me as “i get to decide when i do and don’t take care of you and the baby even though its inside of you every day.”. before anyone comes for me for being dependent on him, i take care of myself majority of the time and when i need him i make it known. this is where it gets weird.

I told him if he could only take care of me on his time then to gtfo and i will cry and bleed in the bathtub alone when the abortion happens. i also said i’m glad we aren’t having this baby right now. i said this bc of how he was speaking to me i couldn’t imagine being a child in that.

{"prompt":"My (f 28) sister found my (m 26)boyfriend’s dating app account My (f 22) boyfriend (m 26) and I started seeing each other about half a year ago. We’ve had some rough patches but we made it work through communication and my persistence to make things work. \n\nJust about 2 months ago we had a longer talk about our relationship as he wasn’t really putting as much effort into it as I was. My schedule with college and work is fully packed and yet I found more time for him than he did for me, even though he was unemployed at the time. \n\nI actually posted about our situation back then on here and chose to talk things through, rather than break everything off. Now I definitely know, that was a huge mistake. Dude stood me up for new years eve, so he could go to his mom’s place, maybe that should’ve been the first sign something was fishy.\n\nTill this day he hasn’t said that he cares for me, loves me etc. only thing i ever got out of him is that i was important to him and that’s why we shouldn’t break up. I took his word and we decided to give things another try, he actually had started doing a lot more for the relationship. We talked more, we made more plans together etc. \n\nYesterday however, my (f 28) sister called me and asked me again how old he was. After i replied she also asked if we were still on any dating sites. I said that i wouldn’t say so, i deleted mine as soon as we started talking more seriously back in June 2022. Apparently he hasn’t done the same. She sent me about 10 screenshots of his dating profile on Bumble, where he explicitly has “looking for a relationship” on his profile.\n\nIt get’s worse.\n\nOne of the pictures he used was the one i took of him in my apartment, holding my cat. Dude cropped out the background where all of my pictures with friends and family were on the wall. He had the audacity to add a picture taken by his girlfriend to look for a new girlfriend.\n\nIf you’re thinking that maybe it’s an old account, I sadly have to break the news to you that it isn’t. He used recent pictures of himself. When we got together he had extremely long hair and he cut it in between the months of dating to be short. All of the pictures were him with short hair. Not to mention the picture i had taken was maybe 3 weeks old at best. \n\nI’m at a loss for words with this. I spent the morning till afternoon with him yesterday. We spent half of the day together on the same day i find that out. My best friend drove for an hour to my place after she heard yesterday. She thinks i should just block him and be done for, that he doesn’t deserve an explanation to what he did. \n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to be with someone that after half a year still doesn’t think the relationship is solidified. How do i even go at this? \n\nI would really appreciate some advice on how to best handle this situation. Thank you in advance!\n\nFor whoever wants to read the last post i made about him, here’s the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ztdu84/no_communication/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf","completion":"6 months really isn’t that long and definitely not long enough to be having so many relationship problems. It doesn’t sound like he was ever really treating this as a serious relationship, especially if he wasn’t telling you anything except you are “important” to him and then turns around and blows you off and cheats. I think we know he wasn’t really at his mom’s on New Years at this point lol \n\nSo I think your sister is right—just block him and move on. He already knows exactly what he did and he’s not going to bother with any meaningful discussion.\n\nYou’re 22–too old to mess with his immature BS. And moving forward, try to remember the handy little saying “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”"}
{"prompt":"I am a 26F hung up on a 38M - Which Choice is Better? Edit: 28 year old male******\n\nI know I need to move on from this guy for multiple reasons. For my own sanity, I’d like to not see his social media posts so that I forget about him quicker. However, given that I do still care a little, I want to know which method sends him the message that I basically don’t care about him at all. \n\n1- mute his profile on Instagram. Assuming he checks his story views, he won’t ever see my name; but, because I still technically follow him, he would think that I just don’t check his profile anymore? The problem with this is that I’d still check his profile in a moment of weakness and I probably will still check for his views in my story. \n\n2- unfollow him on Instagram. That sends a little bit more of a “I want nothing to do with you” message; but I worry it will come across like I care too much and I’m petty and insecure. Also might still check for his views in my story unless I make him unfollow me as well. \n\n3- block him on Instagram. I like the idea of blocking because if I ever have a moment of weakness in the future, I won’t be able to see his profile unless I unblock and send him a new follow request, and I probably won’t do that because it draws more attention. BUT, again, he may eventually notice that I’ve blocked him and I do not want him to think I’m hung up on him to the point of blocking…. \n\nBasically I want the best method to send the message that I’m indifferent about him.","completion":"I don’t understand how you finish this with “now I know he won’t have anything for vday.”  He’s made that absolutely crystal clear forever. \n\nWe can all logically sit here and tell you you deserve everything you want and that you’re not being unreasonable to want it. You’re not. \n\nBut the reality is that you’re 10 years in and he’s proven to you for the duration of your relationship that he doesn’t give a flying fuck. \n\nWhen you talk about it, he doesn’t even say he’ll make an effort and then not make an effort. He just gets upset with you, but then you’re still surprised that he doesn’t make an effort. \n\nI’m sorry for coming off as mean here. I promise you that’s not my intention. I just feel the need to be direct with you to hopefully wake you up to reality.  Talk to a lawyer. Good luck."}

{"prompt":"Do I (21f) Have Unrealistic Expectations About My (23m) Online Love Interest? So I (21f) have been talking to Jacob (fake name, 23m) consistently for the last 7 years online, although we are not dating or in a relationship because he lives in Europe while I live in Canada. This summer, I'm going to Europe on vacation, so we agreed to finally meet. I extended my trip an extra week, and we planned to spend time together in a city that's 3 hours away from his home. However, we weren't on the same page with expectations for our situation. We've always talked about being together (getting married, who would move where, careers, kids, dreams, etc) but I'm now realizing that this was all fantastical daydreaming that wasn't being taken seriously by him. Of course, the logical part of my brain has always been aware that our situation may not work out. We may not like each other in person, and I've kept it in the back of my mind that no true commitment will ever happen until we actually meet and get a feel for each other. However, the emotional, blindly optimistic, naive side got caught up in the fantasy of what we could be. So, on to the situation, this happened back in December, and we were planning to meet in July. I cant for the life of me remember how the conversation got brought up, but Jacob let me know that he's not looking for a relationship and doesn't want to be in love again for a very long time (mind you this was less than 7 months before our meet up) and I felt my heart break a little. My mom told me while it sucks, I should have never grown attached to someone I've never met and of course everything was all fantasy because he didn't have any real obligations to me since I wasn't there. It was all talk, so I shouldn't be hurt since he's letting me know what to expect upfront, and I need to either adjust my expectations or don't go. While my coworkers agreed, they also said he's awful for how he went about it and convinced me not to go since he doesn't care about me and this wasn't real for him. They told me to cut him off, but if I did still want to meet him, make him come to me and plan/pay for everything or go 50/50 so we both have something to lose. \n\n(Side note- I planned/paid for the trip, including our hotel room+excursions. All he had to do was show up. However, when I asked him about the things he wanted to do, he told me to do whatever I wanted and he would accompany me since this was technically my vacation even though I centered it around us. Red flag one trillion) \n\nSo I canceled the trip (he was very frustrated and annoyed since I canceled. I also didn't tell him why because I was too embarrassed) and since then, I've been slowly distancing myself and setting up boundaries so I can chip away my attachment/ fantasy of him. I didn't talk to him for almost an entire month, and now we only communicate twice a week when he reaches out to me. But I can't get over this nagging feeling that my expectations were unreasonable. Am I crazy to expect our meet-up to lead to a relationship or, at the very least, the consideration of a relationship? He always tells me it would be different if I was there, but after 7 years of daily conversations, would meeting in person even matter or change anything? I mean, wouldn't you know the person well enough after 7 fucking years to decide whether or not you want a relationship?? Especially since the majority of communication has been centered around your future together? I feel embarrassed and ashamed that I'm being told I expected too much and I'm really struggling with the idea that I wasted 7 years of my life to A. Never meet him in person and B. Never actually date him and see where it goes. The sunk cost fallacy is no joke.","completion":"Reading your story, I'm feeling convinced that he's already in a committed relationship or marriage.  \n\nBe that as it may, stop thinking about him and please, PLEASE date real, local, tangible people.  Don't be hard on yourself, there were good things about your fantasy relationship, but you're one of millions of people who found themselves in this kind of disappointing situation."}

{"prompt":"Why has my 22F ex stayed in contact with me 21F for so long after the breakup? To make a super long story short i got out of a relationship about a year ago. We were together for a year and a half we shared an apartment and two dogs and a whole life together ( lesbians we move fast). The breakup was super messy and my ex moved on that same night basically and she has been with this person ever since. About a week before i moved out of our shared apartment my ex told me she no longer wanted to financially support the dogs since she wouldn’t be able to see them. I told her that was fine and that i wasn’t expecting her to continue anyways but made it very clear that this was her decision to not see them and i would be more than happy to figure something out if she really wanted to. She got super upset and we just left this conversation at that. The next few months were very tense and angry but eventually things died down. About five months after the breakup my ex texted me asking how the dogs were doing, i was shocked but responded because i was very much still holding on and enjoyed the contact. Now it’s been almost a year and we have not gone longer than two weeks without speaking to each other and it’s only happened twice. She went from texting every other week to every ten days to every week to every ten days again. At this point she was showing more interest in them now than she ever did when we were together to be honest she wasn’t that insanely fond of them when we were together it always seemed they were more of a burden to her than anything else. About two weeks ago i decided i’d had enough and told her i wasnt interested in communicating anymore and i wanted to distance myself from her and our situation. She was chill about it said okay and that she wanted to “respect my request” and we haven’t spoke since. I am still so hung up on the fact that she kept in contact for so long about these dogs and i can’t help but wonder if she had an ulterior motive just never had the courage to say anything. Does it seem like she had other reasons or literally just developed a new found interest in these dogs?","completion":"I should.

{"prompt":"Me 23F have feelings for 21M but not healthy \"relationship\", need advice, desperately Hello, first off, I am an overthinker. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I am always trying to guess how people feel about me, particularly in a relationship. I never got love growing up and instead was judged on my looks. My parents never said I love you. I am guessing that is why I always felt the need to have a boyfriend. I want a boyfriend who can give me attention, buy me flowers, call me, go on dates, get coffee together, share memories with. I was in a long distance relationship for 5 years and that didn't work because he cheated on me.\n\nRecently I met this guy. Although I am not in love with him, I like him a little too much. I've been seeing this guy here and there for about 5 months. He used to be very sweet in the beginning and made me feel great. He is new to the US, has a daughter in another country and just came here to make money. He makes mininum wage and says he sends most of it to his family. He never really talks much about his personal life and he always states that the less people know the better. He is also an overthinker and extremely insecure about himself.\n\nSlowly he started to distance himself away from me by not replying as much anymore. He started taking 1 business day to reply lol. When I saw he didn't reply for that long, I tried to distance myself away from him by not texting back but days later he always ends up texting me again. Then the cycle continues he takes forever to reply etc etc. I can clearly tell I'm not his priority, making money is. He's even admitted that.  Whenever we plan to see each other its always up in the air because he has to find time around his schedule. Yesterday he came over my house and he didn't want to do any activities together. He got a phone call from a friend and left. For me, that's disrespectful because if you are with me I expect your full attention.\n\n Anyway everyone is telling me to cut him off. It's probably the best. But thing is I don't want to. I like him too much but I don't like the way he makes me feel worthless because of his actions. He claims he has a rough life and yes, it is true he is going through a lot but tbh it's not fair for me to deal with this. I don't want to cut him off. I had a therapy session today and my therapist said to cut him off and that's when I knew I probably should. I had a panic attack of my way home. I thought I was going to die honestly, my face got numb and every one on the highway was honking at me.\n\nToday he texted me saying that he's having a bad day because his uncle is very sick and he can't go visit him. So now I feel that I can;t stop talking to him because I want to be his support system. I do however want to take a few days to process everything anf know what I will do. I just feel very confused, stupid and worthless. How can I cut him off when I don't want to? My therapist says I am prolonging the agony.

{"prompt":"Me 23F have feelings for 21M but not healthy \"relationship\", need advice, desperately Hello, first off, I am an overthinker. I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I am always trying to guess how people feel about me, particularly in a relationship. I never got love growing up and instead was judged on my looks. My parents never said I love you. I am guessing that is why I always felt the need to have a boyfriend. I want a boyfriend who can give me attention, buy me flowers, call me, go on dates, get coffee together, share memories with. I was in a long distance relationship for 5 years and that didn't work because he cheated on me.\n\nRecently I met this guy. Although I am not in love with him, I like him a little too much. I've been seeing this guy here and there for about 5 months. He used to be very sweet in the beginning and made me feel great. He is new to the US, has a daughter in another country and just came here to make money. He makes mininum wage and says he sends most of it to his family. He never really talks much about his personal life and he always states that the less people know the better. He is also an overthinker and extremely insecure about himself.\n\nSlowly he started to distance himself away from me by not replying as much anymore. He started taking 1 business day to reply lol. When I saw he didn't reply for that long, I tried to distance myself away from him by not texting back but days later he always ends up texting me again. Then the cycle continues he takes forever to reply etc etc. I can clearly tell I'm not his priority, making money is. He's even admitted that.  Whenever we plan to see each other its always up in the air because he has to find time around his schedule. Yesterday he came over my house and he didn't want to do any activities together. He got a phone call from a friend and left. For me, that's disrespectful because if you are with me I expect your full attention.\n\n Anyway everyone is telling me to cut him off. It's probably the best. But thing is I don't want to. I like him too much but I don't like the way he makes me feel worthless because of his actions. He claims he has a rough life and yes, it is true he is going through a lot but tbh it's not fair for me to deal with this. I don't want to cut him off. I had a therapy session today and my therapist said to cut him off and that's when I knew I probably should. I had a panic attack of my way home. I thought I was going to die honestly, my face got numb and every one on the highway was honking at me.\n\nToday he texted me saying that he's having a bad day because his uncle is very sick and he can't go visit him. So now I feel that I can;t stop talking to him because I want to be his support system. I do however want to take a few days to process everything anf know what I will do. I just feel very confused, stupid and worthless. How can I cut him off when I don't want to? My therapist says I am prolonging the agony. I just cant do this anymore, I just cant stand to see the time go by and him not communicating with me. I can't stand liking him and not being treated the way I want to. He's not what I am looking for but why am I so attracted to him and like him so much. He's not going to change but how do I make myself  believe that?

Too hot, too scratchy, not big enough, etc. \n\nEven if it fit him perfectly two years ago, it might not fit now. He wore it just fine for the holidays that year with no complaint. You made sure to mention you had very little to make that happen. He didn’t want you to feel that your purchase was wasted or for you to have to return it. I think that’s pretty considerate.\n\nAnd now, because he didn’t grab it when he was cold in the present time it’s this big of an issue? It’s not a personal dig at you because he didn’t grab your family Christmas sweater, again, two years later. This is harsh, but, babe- get a grip."}

{"prompt":"Should I [f21] tell my boyfriend [m22] about our first break up My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. I’ve never loved someone as much as I’ve loved this man. He is my sun, my stars, my moon, and everything in between. I want nothing more than to make him happy and give him the life he deserves. Unfortunately, I haven’t always been this way. \n\nWe got together in high school when I was 17. He had the biggest crush on me and did so many sweet and thoughtful things. I did really like him to start off but I was so self centered in high school. All I thought about was myself and who I was gonna be and what I wanted out of life. Looking back on things, I feel so poorly for having taken him for granted. About 7 months into the relationship, I decided to break it off with him. I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I didn’t flirt back until having messaged him. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. \n\nMy therapist said that this sounds like a normal teenage thing to do and that I need to learn to control my obsessive thoughts but I feel like this is different. I feel like if I don’t tell him then I’m keeping it a secret. We’ve been dating now for 4 years and I feel like I owe him the honesty. Everyone else has told me to move past it, and that telling him would just hurt his feelings and maybe even make him question me for still thinking about it 4 years later. I haven’t thought of it until this last month but now that I have remembered it, I can’t stop thinking about it. \n\nDo I tell him for honesty sake or do I keep it to myself? Should I feel as shitty as I do or was this just a mistake in my past? Everyone is telling me the opposite of what my brain is feeling.","completion":"Listen to your therapist.

I'm talking about stuff like someone stalking her/not accepting a breakup and showing up at her place. Or having someone in the family who does 'gifts with strings attached' (aka gifting her something and then holding it above her head, in a 'I got you this thing, so now you gotta be thankful and do X for me'-way) and she might have gotten triggered, thinking that you showing up means you expected something in return? \n\nThat said, even if all of that doesn't apply, some people just really don't like surprises in general or surprise-visits. Like, some women are insecure and don't want to be seen by a relatively new dating partner without having had time to dress nicely. Or, given how involved the parents still seem, she might have had to defend you and got super-stressed and is now having family issues. \n\nOverall, I would suggest you just wait until she contacts you again and then, the next time you see each other in person, you sit down together and talk about what happened and what this means for the future and if she doesn't want surprise-visits at all or maybe just if it's sure that her parents won't be around or whatever."}

What they're asking for is pretense rather than the true exchange of emotions, meaning that by definition it isn't \"quality time\".

The main reason for the post is because once she decided to hang up the phone, she said she was never gonna call me again.\n\nShe said that if I want to talk with her, it’s only ever gonna be if I call her first, claiming she’s not gonna call me now because I never make the effort to call her.\n\nI know she’s probably saying it out of anger, but it bothers me because it’s not the first time she’s done something like that. She always threatens to do something like that after arguments, like that she won’t call, she won’t treat me as nicely anymore, blah blah blah. It’s just small unnecessary comments that end up hurting me a lot. They didn’t bother much at first, but the more they add up, the more it annoys me I guess.\n\nMaybe it’s just normal in relationships, since this is my first and I’m still learning. Any opinions would be appreciated.\n\nTl;dr my gf always threatens me with small things after we finish arguing,like not calling me ever again. Not sure if this is normal or a problem","completion":"\\*Maybe it’s just normal in relationships\\*\n\nNo. No, it's not normal at all, Op.\n\n\\*She said that if I want to talk with her, it’s only ever gonna be if I call her first\\*\n\n\\*she won’t treat me as nicely anymore\\*\n\nChildish, immature mind games, Op.

Which is very hard on him and on me in some ways.\n\nI've been trying my best these past 3 months to get him to do something that is good for him. (Read, maybe get a part time job, be active, take an online course, something) Occasionally he plays his guitar which is great but rare. \n\nThis has been hard on me b/c I'm constantly trying to improve myself and other than being supportive idk what to do. I feel like this isn't good for me either.\n\nI feel I really messed up through bad timing of bringing this up while he's trying to quit nicotine, but I've been feeling rage and getting angry at little things and on ik why, it b/c I'm frustrated with him. So he asked if I was ok and I told him everything. I said some stuff like why doesn't he do anything and he's acting like a loser. He's taking this very hard and I deeply regret bringing it up. We were supposed to celebrate vday today but I guess that's no longer happening he just wants to be alone.\n\nI have a very very important job interview on Monday and have been spending a lot of time preparing and he has shown no support. We are both looking for remote jobs so we could move to a better place. I'm trying to get through my emotions, support himm, and prepare for my interview. \n\nI'm not sure if there's anything I can do for him....what I said was honest and he said he had it coming but I picked a bad time. Ik he is depressed, but he doesn't talk about his feelings. Breaking up is not something I'm down for he is a great guy. I just wish he had some kind of motivation in life. Any advice?:/","completion":"Both of you working from home is gonna be a disaster to happen."}

No, you’re not selfish to be frustrated by it. No, you’re not co-dependent to again be frustrated by it. \n\nNow having said that, that doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t co-dependent either. I wouldn’t have even thought to discuss a topic like this at all if you hadn’t brought it up, but when you said something like wanting to stay in on weekend nights makes you feel incredibly alone, that might come off as codependent. The reason for that is not because you’re crazy to want to spend weekend nights with your partner; it’s because you could logically say the same thing about any other night of the week. Could you not find any other way to occupy yourself? Enjoy a hobby? See friends? What did you do before he existed?\n\nTo bring it all back, you logically aren’t remotely crazy to not want a relationship dynamic like this. It’s just incredibly frustrating.  There’s obviously workarounds where you can both make an effort to make this work, but that you “can” do it doesn’t mean either of you “will” do it or want to. \n\nAs it stands, it seems you don’t want to.

But i'll have to say yes its \"disrespectful\" to a certain degree only if you think you feel disrespected if not just move on. Many women tend to mentality check out from a relationship weeks or months before the actual break-up. So her being on a tender date 5 days after the break up she was already planning on doing so.  There's one saying I lived by for many years. \"She's not yours, it was just your turn\" \n\nYou being a young 18 years old will move on from this and find another lady that you can date and build something with. So I hope this helps. Work on yourself, learn a new skill and continue moving forward. Don't worry about her any longer and you'll be fine in the end."}

He's been becoming friends with a female coworker 22f. I never had any doubts at first until he'd start ignoring me to text her, texting all the time, wanting to hang out one on one, I set some boundries and he seemed to follow them.\n\nHe lied. He had been continuing to text and get closer to her. He always calls me after work and 3 nights ago, his phone died but he always calls me when he gets home (about 20 minutes later) that time goes by and I start to panic, it isnt like him. He finally calls at 2am, 2 hours later and said he was with a friend at applebees after work. I was so upset and scared something happened to him. I said I was glad he was ok but to contact me if that happened.\n\nFlash foward today we were hanging out, he broke down in tears saying he was sorry and I asked what was wrong. He said he felt guilty and I should dump him because I deserve better than him, I prodded and he admitted to emotionally and sexually cheating on me, with the coworker he SWORE there was nothing going on.

{"prompt":"I(19m) did something behind my girlfriend(18f)'s back and feel terrible about it so for some context my girlfriend(18) is very anti-porn, because of how she was raised. i(19, m) am not anti porn, and before we started dating i watched porn regularly. we have been dating for almost a year now. we had talked about it a few times and i eventually agreed to stop watching porn, but i wasnt able to. i think i had a porn addiction because it felt like i couldnt control myself when i would watch it. anyway this went on for a few months and eventually the guilt caught up with me and i told her. we almost broke up over it but she decided to give me a second chance to change and i have. that was about a month ago. i havent watched porn since, but i just saw a thirst trap on instagram and ended up masturbating to it and now i feel absolutely terrible. its not exactly porn, and other than this ive been doing great. i really want to apologize and think i should but i fear she would break up with me, which is fair because i broke her trust twice. but i love her a lot and i dont know why i did that and i dont know what to do. any advice on what to do? and please dont say things like im a terrible person and horrible and she should just break up with me, i already know that im terrible, i just want to know how to go about apologizing to her.","completion":"You're not compatible.

Things went really good and some of it maybe a bit too fast.  \nthings went a bit downhill after 5 months like less attraction at her side and less sex.  \n(Honeymoon phase probs)\n\nI had a bit of weird feeling about it, asked about it and it gave me some fague anwsers.  \nHad a bit of a gut feeling bcs things went downhill.\n\nWe always been very open in this relationship from start and talk very open and honest about everything.  \nNow the thing comes up. She has a motor friend, she didnt talk with me about. never said his name but his name came up on her Insta and snap.\n\nFound it a bit weird, maybe im insecure or something but she told me mostly who are her friends.And his name didnt come up.  \nNow she goes duo riding with him and have food with him at her place. That was there first meeting.\n\nBut i saw some weird smileys in her latetly used on whatsapp, that she only used on me when we were talking like sexual/flirting stuff and hearts and blushing emoticons, gave me a weird feeling bcs she didnt send me those for a while. Asked her about it and she was like oh, and explained it to me.  \ni get her explanation but still had a bit of bad gut feeling.  \ni asked her if i could see the msges bcs i dont know what to feel about it. I Had a bit weird gut feeling.\n\nThe thing is she doesnt want me to see the msges bcs they are private.  \nI asked her i had a bad gut feeling about it and want to get that feeling away. It really frustrates me a bit. (She asked the motorfriend if i could see the msges they had together)  \nThing is she doenst know him for that long. Just some random Instagram contact and just met him once when they were duo riding and having food. I know her for like 5 months and have a really good vibe going open to eachother and honest.\n\nI found it weird that she needs to ask permission bcs but hey thats just me.  \nHe didnt want it so she respects his answer and doesnt show me. (we had a bit of a fight online when they were together so he has a bad picture of me)\n\nI told her how annoyed i feel about the emojis and the contact she has with him. i just want to feel assured there is nothing. But i just dont understand why she just not assures me and let me see it. And that his opinion matters more then my gutfeeling. She says its about trust and that i just need to trust her.\n\nIm a bit lost here, what do i do. Im just trying to accept it but it doesnt feel right.  \nI know i cant ask moral judgment here. But maybe i have a blindspot and im totally wrong and intruding here privacy. What do i do?","completion":"Is there any chance your husband would give you a hall pass to see him."}

{"prompt":"My (21F) relationship with my partner (24M) has gotten out of control Currently crying as I write this. I’m trapped in a loop where I can’t find the exit. I’ll try to be as brief as posible. My partner doesn’t let me dress how I’d like. He doesn’t want me to change colors or cut my hair. I once wanted to do a piercing (I was 20!!) and I had to hide it from him and eventually had to take it off. When we started dating I told him, very clearly, that my grandma, who raised me, died a few years prior and when I grew up I wanted to get her name tattooed (nothing crazy, something little) and he said of course. Now it’s a really heated discussion whenever I state that I want to do it and he was okay with it and he simply says “no im not okay with seeing your skin tattooed what the f is that?” And I just have to leave it there. I’ve been wanting to go blonde for 2 years and i can’t. I haven’t been to the beach since 2020. I haven’t worn shorts since then too.

{"prompt":"My boyfriend(23M) and I (21F) cant work together creatively My boyfriend and I found each other online,We've been dating for 3 years now. We draw together here and there when he is motivated. Which is rare. We've tried to work together before but every single time its failed. Often times what happens is he loses interest and I end up doing all of the work or he just argues with me on it. I get that I must compromise and most of the time I am completely happy to do so but he does REALLY annoying things. One time we were getting ready to come up with a big idea for a pitch contest for an animated show. We both dont work in the industry professionally but we thought it'd be fun to give it a shot since we both love animation. I start with the most basic question...\n\n\"So what should the tone be?\" He would respond with something like \"So what if we have a show where its this guy and-\" he gets way ahead of himself so i tell him \"Why dont we just figure out the tone first and then we can go into characters and world building\" because I wanted the pitch to be equal parts both of us. If we work through the basics we'll have an easier time with writing the actual story. He sighs and rolls his eyes and says stuff like \"This sucks,This isn't a good creative process\" and the whole time im just sitting there thinking \"Why cant he just answer that question. And its always like that. He never just gives you a straight answer even if you do try it his way he gets annoyed if you dont like the idea or try to add on to it. Its really annoying. Trying to create anything together almost always ends in a fight. \n\nThe one thing we have been able to successfully do is a sketchbook collaborative comic. We had covid so to entertain ourselves we began drawing a comic together to pass the time. It was really fun. We could be really random and just draw whatever we wanted. Eventually we decided how we would end the comic because our friends were really enjoying reading it AND...He lost interest again. So at first I asked him if he wanted to just talk to me about what he wanted to happen in the comic and I would draw it. Cause it had already got to the point that I was the one drawing the whole thing.\n\nHe couldn't even do that. When I would bring up the comic to ask something he'd say stuff like \"IDK, figure it out. Its good to practice writing for characters that arent yours.\" I had gotten the feeling he had lost interest because now I am drawing the comic and writing all of the characters dialogue. I would just leave him alone about it after that...but after 3 months I asked him if he'd like to pick the comic back up. He said no so I just asked him if he doesn't wanna do it anymore. Instead of saying yes he said no and told me its because there's not enough action or something? So I reminded him that its a sketchbook comic and he can do whatever he wants, then he says the story is too longform so I tell him we can end it and start a \"4 koma\" kinda thing.\n\nThe 4 koma was never touched by him after another 3 months. I didn't say anything. Yesterday I took all of the comic pages out of my sketchbook to stable them together and give them to a friend. While I was doing this I told him how I felt about his stubbornness when it comes to doing stuff together and how frustrated I was that he didn't just tell me he was uninterested in the collab comic instead I was sitting there drawing all of the pages and changing elements of the story, scrapping things, and putting in things he said he'd like more just to be ignored. None of that stuff would've worked. I really wish he just told me he didn't like doing it anymore. \n\nI think im upset that I have to come to terms with the fact that my own boyfriend could be so incompatible with me in terms of creativity. It sucks. I cant help but feel disappointed. Doing anything with him, even one drawing feels like being assigned homework with a partner who doesn't actually do anything.","completion":"He gets mad at you ??

And its always like that. He never just gives you a straight answer even if you do try it his way he gets annoyed if you dont like the idea or try to add on to it. Its really annoying. Trying to create anything together almost always ends in a fight. \n\nThe one thing we have been able to successfully do is a sketchbook collaborative comic. We had covid so to entertain ourselves we began drawing a comic together to pass the time. It was really fun. We could be really random and just draw whatever we wanted. Eventually we decided how we would end the comic because our friends were really enjoying reading it AND...He lost interest again. So at first I asked him if he wanted to just talk to me about what he wanted to happen in the comic and I would draw it. Cause it had already got to the point that I was the one drawing the whole thing.\n\nHe couldn't even do that. When I would bring up the comic to ask something he'd say stuff like \"IDK, figure it out. Its good to practice writing for characters that arent yours.\" I had gotten the feeling he had lost interest because now I am drawing the comic and writing all of the characters dialogue. I would just leave him alone about it after that...but after 3 months I asked him if he'd like to pick the comic back up. He said no so I just asked him if he doesn't wanna do it anymore. Instead of saying yes he said no and told me its because there's not enough action or something? So I reminded him that its a sketchbook comic and he can do whatever he wants, then he says the story is too longform so I tell him we can end it and start a \"4 koma\" kinda thing.\n\nThe 4 koma was never touched by him after another 3 months. I didn't say anything. Yesterday I took all of the comic pages out of my sketchbook to stable them together and give them to a friend. While I was doing this I told him how I felt about his stubbornness when it comes to doing stuff together and how frustrated I was that he didn't just tell me he was uninterested in the collab comic instead I was sitting there drawing all of the pages and changing elements of the story, scrapping things, and putting in things he said he'd like more just to be ignored. None of that stuff would've worked. I really wish he just told me he didn't like doing it anymore. \n\nI think im upset that I have to come to terms with the fact that my own boyfriend could be so incompatible with me in terms of creativity.

Always a bad idea. Keep your creative partner pure so you can work together for as long as possible. And you can use the angst from your sex partner in your work more freely.

I only addressed it after 3 months of nothing happening. I didn't address it in a mean way either,I only  asked him if he wants me to draw the comic for now on.  Another thing is when we work on things creatively the idea is that we both get a say. Of course sometimes I critique aspects during the throwing shit at the wall process but Im not the only one who does that! When you're working with someone creatively its definitely normal to go back and forth on ideas and to change plans. We dont tell each other what to do or how to do it. We've figured that doesn't work already. The reason we did the collab comic is because we can draw whatever we please. Im not annoyed at him \"Not doing it right\". Im annoyed that he kept saying he wanted to keep doing it when I'd ask him \"Hey if you dont wanna do the comic anymore you dont have to\" instead of just saying how he actually felt hed ask me to change things and those changes went nowhere.\n\nSo basically Im running around redrawing scenes he says he doesnt like or adding stuff he says he wants there to be and drawing everything when I finally addressed it by taking out the comic pages he admits he'd lost interest. Its more so about emotional honesty. Of course Im sad we dont work well together creatively buy definitely more angry about the other thing."}

If you think it's cheating- it's cheating.\n\nBoundaries don't have to be communicated to be crossed- you didn't have to tell her 10 years ago, or at all in advance that her behavior crossed your boundaries/is cheating.

I went on 3 dates with him, 1st was drinks and a walk around town for a few hours, 2nd was a movie and another walk with lots of kissing, and 3rd was hanging out at his, with another walk and then back to his where we slept together and i stayed for a while and happened to meet his parents (he lives with them). I know it maybe seems fast to meet his parents but that was just how the situation played out and i know in the long term it wasn't long dating but i feel like i learnt a lot about him in such a short time. But after 2 weeks at my parents i found myself missing my technically ex at that point, i figured i really did love him and from the things he was messaging me he seemed to have finally understood how stressed and lonely i was and that things had to change, so i came back.\nSince then, on and off, I can't stop thinking about this other guy, I don't know if I'm just lusting as the sex just.. different, not better or worse but different, i got to use my kinky side which i missed.

If he's taking multi-hour long baths or showers or cooking 6-course meals and not cleaning up that's different than regular usage. \n\nDerek is allowed to have friends over. It would be completely inappropriate to ask or tell him not to. (I will say, though, that a multi-day houseguest on a regular basis is a lot. Is there a reason Derek can't visit him sometimes?) \n\nYour boyfriend doesn't like Mel coming over. (He doesn't have to!) If he's this unhappy then perhaps he could stay elsewhere (with one of his friends) when Mel visits. \n\nYour boyfriend not liking Mel isn't your problem to solve.

{"prompt":"My (24f) first car crash in my Bf (29M)’s gifted car to me My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year now. Things have always moved fast for us but we were clear about our intentions and feelings the whole time. We met and then labeled ourselves as dating a few days later. I constantly slept over and then moved in a couple weeks later, and I worked from home while he had night shifts so I had the time to pack him a little lunch before he left now and then. \n\nThree weeks ago, I just came back from an overseas trip of about two months with my mom. It was to visit my extended family and my sick grandma but it was also a chance to rebuild my rocky relationship with my mom. \n\nDuring the time away, my boyfriend and I were able to get some space apart but also realize how special our relationship was to us. \n\nTo my surprise, I came home to a set of car keys. He had bought, and then worked on a small, used car for me. He cleaned it all up, replaced parts, topped up the fuel, changed the oil and even put in a new air freshener. \n\nFinances aside, I could tell he put a lot of handiwork and effort into it for me. As well as the time spent on the used car market looking for something that worked for me. He specifically looked for a car that was feul efficient and small that i could take to my works studio on the days I didnt want to work from home, and also so I could spend more time out of the house and with my colleagues and friends. \n\nFlash forward to three weeks past since i got back and current day, last night he was driving home from work and saw my car pulled to the side on the highway with my blinkers on.

He really liked me and was happy in our relationship but I wasn’t sure how I felt at the start. I was 17 and I felt like I didn’t know who I was or what I wanted in life. Looking back on it, I definitely overthought everything instead of just being happy where I was at.\n\nAbout 7-8 months into the relationship I decided to break things off. I had been wanting to for probably 3 months and just kept waiting. The same night I broke up with him, I was flirtatious with a girl I knew from high school over text. She was already texting me for whatever reason and I knew she had a crush on me. I don’t really remember what was said because it was 3 years ago. I feel like the conversation may have gotten flirty before I broke up with him. Not as in I was trying to pursue a relationship but just girls being flirty with girls. Or that’s at least how I thought of it at the time. Over the past years I honestly haven’t thought about it until last month.

I don’t remember why she was messaging me in the first place and I’m nervous that I may have been flirty or leading her on before fully breaking things off with my boyfriend and what that means. I already had full intentions to break things off with him and I didn’t think much of being flirty with a girl just because I wasn’t sure how I felt. I remember wanting to go ahead and break things off at the moment because I didn’t want to cross any lines but I can’t for the life of me remember why she was messaging me in the first place and I’m scared that I may have already crossed a line.

I got her Instagram and then she told me she had a boyfriend. I respected that and tried to talk to her as a friend but the energy she gave did not interested.

One day I got the courage to actually go up and talk to her. We talked in the gym for like 30 minutes straight. I found out we’re from the same country too which made me like her 1000x even more.

After our convo I asked her out and she said yes, but then she stood me up a day before.\n\nAt this time I had her number and was texting her often to try to get to know about her. I was always the first one to text and her messages were dry. I asked her multiple times for when we would go out and she’ll give me a date then tell me day of or day before something came up. She would prank call me with her friend and just laugh at me while her friend “C” calls me names like “desperate” and “thirsty”.

For the past 3 years, she's always kept her grip on reality and could separate her life from her studies and work. Recently, however, I've noticed the way she behaves is changing.\n\nShe's started not caring about the household chores we both decided to split 50/50 since we started living together last year. I asked her about it, and she just said \"So what? Do you really care?\". We had a conversation recently in which she questioned why people feel sad when loved ones die, since it's inevitable and 'we're all just a bunch of cells', I told her I would be sad if she died and she wondered how 'cells can make other cells feel a certain way about other cells,'. I asked if she'd be sad if I died, she said 'Maybe, but there's no reason to be'. We also discussed the morality of murder and kidnap, and she claimed it wouldn't matter to her, as she still claims people are 'just cells'.\n\nWe were supposed to go out tonight for weekly date night, and she told me she didn't want to, I said it was tradition, she just told me to 'cry about it'.

I asked her why, if she was just cells and I was just cells, she told me she didn't know, but she did love me.\n\nI don't know what to do. She's never been like this since I met her, but she's just started behaving this way recently. Before, she was loving, caring, always happy to go out on date night and talked about our future children. Now, she speaks monotonously and bluntly to everyone, only conversation we've had about children was whether she'd care if they died. She claims she's just thinking like a scientist but I don't like it.\n\nI miss the old Effy, I don't like this robotic, sociopathic Effy. I don't understand how she's just changed so suddenly. Any advice is appreciated, I just want the old version of my girlfriend back. \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend has suddenly started behaving differently and stopped thinking emotionally, and is acting uncaring and sociopathic towards everything, but claims she's just 'a scientist'.","completion":"Someone needs a break.  \"NIX\" above...or below 👇 i can't tell, suggested a mental health thing regarding detachment....\n\nSome flags here for sure.

Most mature adults recognize this. \n\nYou’re stressed and unhappy while still in the honey moon phase, ending it is the only practical solution here. \n\nUnfortunately in this scenario she more than likely will be hurt since she’s already so emotionally dependent- BUT that is not a reason to stick it out. Break it off sooner rather than later, don’t let her get more attached. \n\nAlso considering it’s only been a few months, I think it would be completely fair to end things over a phone call and make it a little easier on yourself. Rip the bandaid off and tell her you don’t see this working long term. Don’t go into a lot of detail- that’ll only make it harder. Last thing you want is her offering to change or do something to make you stay. \n\nGood luck, it’s never easy to end things when you know the other person will be crushed but at the same time you can’t stick around to avoid hurting her.

{"prompt":"Possibly Going Cold? 18m &amp; 19f &amp;#x200B;\n\nSo  I (18m) recently started seeing this girl (19f) from Tinder.

We get  along really well, have a ton in common, have a similar sense of humor,  she's easy to talk to, and we have a really good time every time we see  each other. We finally kissed at the end of our 4th date, and later in  that day I actually came down with a case of covid. Miraculously, she's  avoided catching it and has been fine. But, needless to say, we haven't  seen each other in like 5 days, we've just been texting. I facetimed her  the other night, and for some reason, it just seemed off. We talked for  like an hour, and it just felt dry, like we were just meeting again, or  we had lost our chemistry. You might be able to chalk it up to me  having no energy from covid, or maybe something was happening with her,  but it made me kind of worried. It also doesn't help that we both have  really bad texting habits, where we wait a long time to text each other  back (usually not so long, like half an hour to and hour and a half).

There is only any given individual's willingness to respond immediately and if you're both laid back about this you're probably a good fit in that regard.

Both parties in this scenario had kids from other prior marriages as well.   \nKids dont live with him (for context).  \nAfter the first week of dating he ghosted me for 5 days straight, he was supposed to be at an event, I messaged him to have fun and talk to him when he got back....he never went apparently he stayed home, as the event reminded him of her as they went there last together....after he finally reached out, he apologized and I said (and I meant it) that I understand, and if he wants to or needs to ever talk about her to not worry about me being weirded out, I get it. I lost someone a long time ago as well. She was a big part of his history.  \nI rarely hear from him, nor do I pester him, but sometimes it will be 2-3 days before I get word from him or get response to ONE of my texts.  \nI am not sure if I am just  reading into things too much though.   \nPart of me is thinking - he didn't give enough time between her passing to truly mourn her, or that he is still pining for her.

Not saying they should, that is up to them. However there is no shame in asking. That being said….. if you do ask and they say no, don’t badger or whine about it.

They legitimately go to his house daily because they WANT to. Any time I'm home, I jump at the opportunity to babysit family for free.

{"prompt":"I (27F) thought I was straight until I met C (27F) now I'm questioning everything. Apologies for the length, I'm kind of freaking out. I will put a TLDR at the end. I'll call myself E, just for clarity. I'm 27F, and met C, also 27F about 6 months ago completely by coincidence at a bar. Up to and including that point I thought I was totally 100% straight. I was never attracted to women or had a crush on any woman. I've only ever had crushes on men. I've never been in a serious relationship, but have been in sevral situationships with men. I've never felt any attraction to women or any kind of romantic desire towards them, I made out with a couple of girls in college but it did nothign for me tbh.\n\n6 months ago I was at a bar celebrating a promotion at work with a small group of friends. About halfway through the night, C entered the bar to meet with her friends who were sitting at a table not far from ours. I'm not kidding when I say that the entire energy of the bar changed the second she walked in. People stopped mid-sentence to look at her, the entire place quietened significantly. I was curious so I looked up to see what everyone was looking at, saw her and I thought 'oh she's kind of pretty, I guess' and then she saw one of her friends and smiled at them from across the room and I swear my friend next to me audibly gasped. I thought that she looked friendly, and that she looked like she had a good energy. I definitely noticed her but everyone did. Later, one of my friends commented part way through the night that C's table seemed to be getting a lot of attention from men, which she seemed to be very gently turning down. I hadn't really noticed but it definitely seems true. I never thought much of it. Then, towards the end of the night, my friends left and I decided to have a couple of drinks by myself so I moved to the bar, which was basically right in front of C and her friends' table. I got a drink and part way through, a man interrupted me and started flirting with me, I politely told him that I wasn't interested. He wouldn't take no for an answer and bugged me for about 20 more minutes. I was starting to get increasingly uncomfortable. Then out of nowhere, C appears and says \"Oh my God!! Hi, I wasn't expecting to run into you here, I haven't seen you in such a long time! Sorry to take you away from your friend but you have to catch me up. Come sit with me and my friends!\" and pulled me away. There was a brief moment where I was really confused and worried that we actually had met before becausde she was so convincing, but we definitely hadn't. I spent the rest of the night with her and her friends, she walked me home, put me to bed with some advil and 2 bottles of water and left me a really sweet note with her number and asking me to let her know I was okay in the morning. And so the next morning, I texted her and thanked her, letting her know I was hungover but okay. \n\nWe've talked everyday since. A week later she invited me to have brunch with her and I got to know her better. I have to say that I've noticed everywhere we go, people notice her. She never notices. People (including me) hang onto her every word. She's the most fascinating person I've ever met in my life and I want to know everything about her. She's so kind, gentle, patient, generous and I'm convinced she's actually a genius. She's working on her 2nd PhD. She tells the most ridiculous jokes that make me laugh anyway. Rooms feel different when she's in them. She's observant and purposeful. She started a program where she teaches beginner English to recent immigrants and refugess, then when they graduate she puts them in touch with local community colleges and helps them get into outreach and housing programs. She writes amazing poetry, she's amazing with children even though I know that they make her feel uncomfortable. A couple of months ago, she calmed me down from a panic attack and brought me a diet coke after, commenting on how she's noticed when I have a panic attack I always drink a diet coke after. I told her no one else had ever noticed that before and this woman looked me directly in the eyes and with the gentlest smile said \"well, then maybe other people need to look harder\". I am utterly enthralled with this woman. I don't think there's been a day since we met I haven't thought about her passively throughout the day. I would honestly listen to her recite the phonebook and not get bored.\n\nIt all came to a head a few days ago where we had arranged to have a dinner after the undergrad class she teaches was over. I agreed to pick her up. I left a little earlier than I needed to because I expected traffic to be bad but it was unexpectedly dead. I arrived about half an hour before her class finished and I got to sit in on it. I have never, EVER seen a room full of 100 18 year olds look so enraptured in a lecture in my life. After seeing her teach; I get it. She is so passionate and loves what she does - it radiates off of her. It's captivating. She made a subject I honestly could not give a shit about captivating. She noticed me walk in, smiled and me while she was teaching and it made me blush. Before the end of the lecture she stopped to tie her hair up and I didn't think much of it at the time but it honest to god made me physically sweat. After dinner, we were sitting on my couch and she was attentively listening to me complain about a guy at work. There was a comfortable silence. Up until this point I genuinely still thought I was straight and just really admired her and thought she was cool. But then I was looking at her, I wanted her to kiss me so bad. I have never wanted someone to kiss me this badly before, ever. Since then I haven't been able to stop noticed how insanely, ridiculously attractive absolutely everything she does is. Yesterday I stopped by her place and found myself thinking about how hot she looks pouring herself a glass of water. It's not just that she is physically attractive, she is just so attractive as a person. She's definitely gay, but she thinks I'm straight. I think I'm straight, maybe? I don't know. I haven't found any other women attractive before or since her. But I'm definitely, absolutely attracted to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I met a girl completely by coincidence, thinking I was straight. She thinks I'm straight. I don't know what I want from her, if I want anything from her. I'm confused and freaking out because I definitely have not straight thoughts about her but she's the only woman I've ever been attracted to. Idk what any of it means. I can't talk to her about it bc I'm 95% sure that it's platonic for her, and I'm unsure if it is for me. I don't know what's happening.","completion":"Unfortunately, no.

Hi, I wasn't expecting to run into you here, I haven't seen you in such a long time! Sorry to take you away from your friend but you have to catch me up. Come sit with me and my friends!\" and pulled me away. There was a brief moment where I was really confused and worried that we actually had met before becausde she was so convincing, but we definitely hadn't. I spent the rest of the night with her and her friends, she walked me home, put me to bed with some advil and 2 bottles of water and left me a really sweet note with her number and asking me to let her know I was okay in the morning. And so the next morning, I texted her and thanked her, letting her know I was hungover but okay. \n\nWe've talked everyday since. A week later she invited me to have brunch with her and I got to know her better. I have to say that I've noticed everywhere we go, people notice her. She never notices. People (including me) hang onto her every word. She's the most fascinating person I've ever met in my life and I want to know everything about her. She's so kind, gentle, patient, generous and I'm convinced she's actually a genius. She's working on her 2nd PhD. She tells the most ridiculous jokes that make me laugh anyway. Rooms feel different when she's in them. She's observant and purposeful. She started a program where she teaches beginner English to recent immigrants and refugess, then when they graduate she puts them in touch with local community colleges and helps them get into outreach and housing programs. She writes amazing poetry, she's amazing with children even though I know that they make her feel uncomfortable. A couple of months ago, she calmed me down from a panic attack and brought me a diet coke after, commenting on how she's noticed when I have a panic attack I always drink a diet coke after. I told her no one else had ever noticed that before and this woman looked me directly in the eyes and with the gentlest smile said \"well, then maybe other people need to look harder\". I am utterly enthralled with this woman. I don't think there's been a day since we met I haven't thought about her passively throughout the day. I would honestly listen to her recite the phonebook and not get bored.\n\nIt all came to a head a few days ago where we had arranged to have a dinner after the undergrad class she teaches was over. I agreed to pick her up. I left a little earlier than I needed to because I expected traffic to be bad but it was unexpectedly dead. I arrived about half an hour before her class finished and I got to sit in on it. I have never, EVER seen a room full of 100 18 year olds look so enraptured in a lecture in my life. After seeing her teach; I get it. She is so passionate and loves what she does - it radiates off of her. It's captivating. She made a subject I honestly could not give a shit about captivating. She noticed me walk in, smiled and me while she was teaching and it made me blush. Before the end of the lecture she stopped to tie her hair up and I didn't think much of it at the time but it honest to god made me physically sweat. After dinner, we were sitting on my couch and she was attentively listening to me complain about a guy at work. There was a comfortable silence. Up until this point I genuinely still thought I was straight and just really admired her and thought she was cool. But then I was looking at her, I wanted her to kiss me so bad. I have never wanted someone to kiss me this badly before, ever. Since then I haven't been able to stop noticed how insanely, ridiculously attractive absolutely everything she does is. Yesterday I stopped by her place and found myself thinking about how hot she looks pouring herself a glass of water. It's not just that she is physically attractive, she is just so attractive as a person. She's definitely gay, but she thinks I'm straight. I think I'm straight, maybe? I don't know. I haven't found any other women attractive before or since her. But I'm definitely, absolutely attracted to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I met a girl completely by coincidence, thinking I was straight. She thinks I'm straight. I don't know what I want from her, if I want anything from her. I'm confused and freaking out because I definitely have not straight thoughts about her but she's the only woman I've ever been attracted to. Idk what any of it means.

I was curious so I looked up to see what everyone was looking at, saw her and I thought 'oh she's kind of pretty, I guess' and then she saw one of her friends and smiled at them from across the room and I swear my friend next to me audibly gasped.

I hadn't really noticed but it definitely seems true. I never thought much of it. Then, towards the end of the night, my friends left and I decided to have a couple of drinks by myself so I moved to the bar, which was basically right in front of C and her friends' table.

{"prompt":"I (27F) thought I was straight until I met C (27F) now I'm questioning everything. Apologies for the length, I'm kind of freaking out. I will put a TLDR at the end. I'll call myself E, just for clarity. I'm 27F, and met C, also 27F about 6 months ago completely by coincidence at a bar. Up to and including that point I thought I was totally 100% straight. I was never attracted to women or had a crush on any woman. I've only ever had crushes on men. I've never been in a serious relationship, but have been in sevral situationships with men. I've never felt any attraction to women or any kind of romantic desire towards them, I made out with a couple of girls in college but it did nothign for me tbh.\n\n6 months ago I was at a bar celebrating a promotion at work with a small group of friends. About halfway through the night, C entered the bar to meet with her friends who were sitting at a table not far from ours. I'm not kidding when I say that the entire energy of the bar changed the second she walked in. People stopped mid-sentence to look at her, the entire place quietened significantly. I was curious so I looked up to see what everyone was looking at, saw her and I thought 'oh she's kind of pretty, I guess' and then she saw one of her friends and smiled at them from across the room and I swear my friend next to me audibly gasped. I thought that she looked friendly, and that she looked like she had a good energy. I definitely noticed her but everyone did. Later, one of my friends commented part way through the night that C's table seemed to be getting a lot of attention from men, which she seemed to be very gently turning down. I hadn't really noticed but it definitely seems true. I never thought much of it. Then, towards the end of the night, my friends left and I decided to have a couple of drinks by myself so I moved to the bar, which was basically right in front of C and her friends' table. I got a drink and part way through, a man interrupted me and started flirting with me, I politely told him that I wasn't interested. He wouldn't take no for an answer and bugged me for about 20 more minutes. I was starting to get increasingly uncomfortable. Then out of nowhere, C appears and says \"Oh my God!! Hi, I wasn't expecting to run into you here, I haven't seen you in such a long time! Sorry to take you away from your friend but you have to catch me up. Come sit with me and my friends!\" and pulled me away. There was a brief moment where I was really confused and worried that we actually had met before becausde she was so convincing, but we definitely hadn't. I spent the rest of the night with her and her friends, she walked me home, put me to bed with some advil and 2 bottles of water and left me a really sweet note with her number and asking me to let her know I was okay in the morning. And so the next morning, I texted her and thanked her, letting her know I was hungover but okay. \n\nWe've talked everyday since. A week later she invited me to have brunch with her and I got to know her better. I have to say that I've noticed everywhere we go, people notice her. She never notices. People (including me) hang onto her every word. She's the most fascinating person I've ever met in my life and I want to know everything about her. She's so kind, gentle, patient, generous and I'm convinced she's actually a genius. She's working on her 2nd PhD. She tells the most ridiculous jokes that make me laugh anyway. Rooms feel different when she's in them. She's observant and purposeful. She started a program where she teaches beginner English to recent immigrants and refugess, then when they graduate she puts them in touch with local community colleges and helps them get into outreach and housing programs. She writes amazing poetry, she's amazing with children even though I know that they make her feel uncomfortable. A couple of months ago, she calmed me down from a panic attack and brought me a diet coke after, commenting on how she's noticed when I have a panic attack I always drink a diet coke after. I told her no one else had ever noticed that before and this woman looked me directly in the eyes and with the gentlest smile said \"well, then maybe other people need to look harder\". I am utterly enthralled with this woman. I don't think there's been a day since we met I haven't thought about her passively throughout the day. I would honestly listen to her recite the phonebook and not get bored.\n\nIt all came to a head a few days ago where we had arranged to have a dinner after the undergrad class she teaches was over. I agreed to pick her up. I left a little earlier than I needed to because I expected traffic to be bad but it was unexpectedly dead. I arrived about half an hour before her class finished and I got to sit in on it. I have never, EVER seen a room full of 100 18 year olds look so enraptured in a lecture in my life. After seeing her teach; I get it. She is so passionate and loves what she does - it radiates off of her. It's captivating. She made a subject I honestly could not give a shit about captivating. She noticed me walk in, smiled and me while she was teaching and it made me blush. Before the end of the lecture she stopped to tie her hair up and I didn't think much of it at the time but it honest to god made me physically sweat. After dinner, we were sitting on my couch and she was attentively listening to me complain about a guy at work. There was a comfortable silence. Up until this point I genuinely still thought I was straight and just really admired her and thought she was cool. But then I was looking at her, I wanted her to kiss me so bad. I have never wanted someone to kiss me this badly before, ever. Since then I haven't been able to stop noticed how insanely, ridiculously attractive absolutely everything she does is. Yesterday I stopped by her place and found myself thinking about how hot she looks pouring herself a glass of water. It's not just that she is physically attractive, she is just so attractive as a person. She's definitely gay, but she thinks I'm straight. I think I'm straight, maybe? I don't know. I haven't found any other women attractive before or since her. But I'm definitely, absolutely attracted to her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I met a girl completely by coincidence, thinking I was straight. She thinks I'm straight. I don't know what I want from her, if I want anything from her. I'm confused and freaking out because I definitely have not straight thoughts about her but she's the only woman I've ever been attracted to. Idk what any of it means.

{"prompt":"Found boyfriend on Tinder (recently active) 33f / 26m Context: our relationship started out as a fwb and later grew into something more serious and after 1.5 years he moved in with me. \n\nI started seeing red flags like feeling like he was hiding a relationship on social media and not putting a label on it. Now that it’s been three months after he moved in he and I decided to become exclusive, and it started to become more serious. It took so long for us to make the big step as he was still working out some commitment issues on his end. I’ve been very patient as if this is his first relationship. We both been single for like six years before meeting each other and we have a connection that is so amazing and easy. He’s my best friend and I am his. Recent issues I’ve had with him have been because I always felt he has one foot in and one foot out of the relationship, sexual intimacy issues (he’s selfish in bed when he wants to be). I always had a gut feeling he might still be talking to other girls. At the time that he moved in, I made a Tinder burner account. The other day I was riding in his car and I found a fresh box of condoms. When I asked him about it, he said about how they’ve been there for more than a year and how he was a really horny guy before we were “officially” together. I felt that was a lie because it looked like a new box. We’ve been having condom-less sex btw. I told him to get rid of the box he happily said yes. Still I was unhappy with him. The next day I found him on tinder with my burner account. He had been active and he was online recently. Coincidentally, he called me right after I took a screenshot of it, and asked me how I was doing when I confronted him and told him that I was afraid that he was gonna break my heart again that I caught him and I wasn’t gonna let him try to cheat on me. Mind you with our first love experiences. We both got cheated on and we talked about how we would never do anything like that to each other.

Of course I called bullshit on it. He was clearly window shopping and possibly talking to some side hoes. He claims that he wouldn’t be a piece of shit to cheat on me and that he downloaded it when we had a really big fight but he wasn’t really thinking of going through with it and actually talking to other girls. I talk to him and I told him “look if you’re not happy in this relationship, then just come clean, but also don’t lie to me.” so imagine that, even after a catch him lying about this, he still denied it until I finally said I can’t love someone who deliberately lies and insults my intelligence”. After he gave up and admitted his mistakes, I decided to forgive him and give him a chance at repairing our trust and connection. I know I’m not gonna be able to trust him for a while even while he’s living with me I’m gonna still keep my burner account active, but am I being a dummy by allowing this to happen?

{"prompt":"Found boyfriend on Tinder (recently active) 33f / 26m Context: our relationship started out as a fwb and later grew into something more serious and after 1.5 years he moved in with me. \n\nI started seeing red flags like feeling like he was hiding a relationship on social media and not putting a label on it. Now that it’s been three months after he moved in he and I decided to become exclusive, and it started to become more serious. It took so long for us to make the big step as he was still working out some commitment issues on his end. I’ve been very patient as if this is his first relationship. We both been single for like six years before meeting each other and we have a connection that is so amazing and easy. He’s my best friend and I am his. Recent issues I’ve had with him have been because I always felt he has one foot in and one foot out of the relationship, sexual intimacy issues (he’s selfish in bed when he wants to be). I always had a gut feeling he might still be talking to other girls. At the time that he moved in, I made a Tinder burner account. The other day I was riding in his car and I found a fresh box of condoms. When I asked him about it, he said about how they’ve been there for more than a year and how he was a really horny guy before we were “officially” together. I felt that was a lie because it looked like a new box. We’ve been having condom-less sex btw. I told him to get rid of the box he happily said yes. Still I was unhappy with him. The next day I found him on tinder with my burner account. He had been active and he was online recently. Coincidentally, he called me right after I took a screenshot of it, and asked me how I was doing when I confronted him and told him that I was afraid that he was gonna break my heart again that I caught him and I wasn’t gonna let him try to cheat on me. Mind you with our first love experiences. We both got cheated on and we talked about how we would never do anything like that to each other. So you can imagine how upset I was when I saw his account and him being recently active on that app. When I sent him the screenshot, he called me back, saying that he coincidentally had been on to delete the app and wasn’t on it, and that the online status was a glitch.

Random throwaway for obvious reasons my fiancé likes this subreddit. Long story short. We’ve been together for 6 years now, and in our relationship we have one problem - parents. She lost her dad due to suicide when she was a kid, it happened on her eyes, so it affected her pretty hard. She still can’t get over it, and cries about it every so often. But, here is the problem - I have 2 parents that I am very close with. I FaceTime them everyday, ask them for help and basically we are in really good relationship. She is in a good relationship with them as well. They like each other and get along pretty well. For some reason she hates me for being able to have such relationship with my parents. Sometimes when she cries and I try to calm her down she screams and me and says some random stuff about how it’s cool to have both parents and to be close with them etc. she always points out that I will not be able to understand her loss, and I should call my mommy and daddy instead. She has a mother, but her mother built another family and doesn’t care about her. Therapy doesn’t work for my fiancé, she is afraid of it. \n\nDoes she think that you should cut off your relationship with your parents in order to heal her emotional trauma? \n\nThat is not reasonable. \n\nIf she is unwilling to face her traumas and work through her complicated emotions here then that is on her, not on you. What is she \"afraid\" of in therapy? What work has she actually done on addressing her grief over her father's death and her mother's abandonment? (And no, screaming at you about having close relationships with your parents doesn't count.)"}

My mother's always had a similarly \"close\" relationship with me, and I personally hate it.  For the most part I just tell her no and/or to stop whatever she's doing/suggestion and just leave it at that as I'm not trying to cause issues with our relationship or my relationship with the rest of our/my family.  But my mother will get weirdly cuddly with me or my brother when just hanging out, she's taken/wears old clothes of my brother's or mine (They become her's and we don't care, I'd never let her wear my own clothes that I still use though, personally, the only other person who can wear currently my clothes is my partner).  My mother has started recently mentioning how she'd love to do a family trip (Father, mother, my brother, and me) without my brother or my partners.  My brother and I, and our partners, don't really appreciate her wanting that.  It also doesn't help that our mother has made some disrespectful comments about my gf and my brother's wife to their faces and behind their backs to myself and my brother.  She's always been overbearing and always gave me an odd feeling that she didn't want me to have a gf throughout my entire life.\n\nPersonally, I've never liked how my mother treats me and thus I've just kinda kept her at arms length to the best of my ability so as to not \"rock the boat\".  And since my gf has gotten to know my mother better (long story short, we moved in with my mother and father from across the state due to career)/we both lived with her for a bit, relationships were strained and my gf asked me to completely cut mom off.  Thankfully, stress levels were high all around and that was a very short lived conversation, and mom has not been cut off, and gf agrees she was being extreme.  Ultimately, I do my best to manage my and my gf relationship with my mother and that works pretty well and my gf respects that.\n\nPer your OP, it seems that YOU think your mother acts \"weird\" with you but you kinda just put up with it cause why \"rock the boat\".  Your gf should trust and respect your decisions on how to deal with your mother.  You briefly mentioned how your mother disrespected your gf, I hope you've been able to handle that as she shouldn't be mistreating/badmouthing your partner.  She should AT THE VERY LEAST respect your decision to be with your gf and thus be amicable with your gf for your sake at the minimum.\n\nI think that if your mom is still being disrespectful towards your gf (not in her weird behavior) then your gf has a right to ask you to stand up for her.\n\nIf your mom is being friendly/nice with your gf and it's just the weird behavior she has around you, then your gf needs to respect your decision on how to handle your mother/to know if her behavior is an actual issue.\n\nPersonally, the clothes thing and the solo trip thing is a no go for me, my partner gets invited to all family events/trips.  But you, and everyone has a different relationship with their parents and so you've gotta decide what is too far and what isn't an issue/normal, and your partner should be able to respect that."}

We toyed with the idea of a threesome, but that's just sex, no emotional investment, and we never went through with it.\nI don't believe that she was genuinely doing this believing I would be okay with it so much as because she felt that something was missing from her life romantically, and instead of coming to me about it she allowed herself to be drawn in by someone else. Even if I would have been okay with something like this, a polyamorous relationship requires all parties to consent, and by keeping this hidden from me for weeks while getting close with this guy, she denied me any respect or input on the matter.\nShe didn't stop immediately on learning that it hurt me. It took several days, and one very challenging conversation, before she agreed to end her conversations with him, and honestly she's broken the trust between us to the point that I'm struggling to  fully believe that she has stopped.\nHer cheating is most certainly cheating, and at least to my mind this kind of emotional infidelity is much more of a betrayal than any physical infidelity could be.\nPosting nudes was something we once enjoyed together- it wasn't about sharing her, it was about the thrill of showing her off, and importantly it was a thrill we shared in. Same is true of the hypothetical threesome, the important bit is that it's something we would do together as a team, not something done for selfish and exclusionary reasons.

However, I went through her chat with BF1, aka her first love, and found out that she continued to speak to him, send I love you texts, and even went to visit him at university, all during the later stages of her BF2 relationship, who she has said she wasn’t that in to.\n\nFrom my perspective this is cheating, but I’m not sure what to do, I love her very much and I know she isn’t cheating on me, she’s cut all these guys off and our relationship is perfect otherwise\n\nWhat do I do? Own up to looking through her phone and ask her about it? Bury the past and just enjoy my relationship?","completion":"I understand where you’re coming from. I have extreme social anxiety, to the point that it has caused seizures at times. When out in public I feel like people are watching me and judging me.\n\nWith that in mind, I am a happily married woman and am VERY in love with my husband. If I see someone I think is attractive and we look at each other at the same time, my eyes instantly look away at ANYTHING else until they walk past me. My husband, before he knew the reason, would always ask me why I looked so nervous and would tell me my face was flushed. I didn’t even know I would turn slightly red as well until he mentioned it to me. \n\nIt took me about a month into our marriage to gather the courage to sit down and have a calm and mature conversation with him and explain why I would look this way. He already knew about the social anxiety so the rest wasn’t to big of a surprise to him. I assured him I love him and only wanted to be with him but that it was a reaction I couldn’t seem to control. \n\nHe laughed and said that he knows that I live him and would never cheat on him and that he understands the reaction. It’s gotten a bit better now and he’ll sometimes tease me about it in a low whisper in my ear when we’re out running errands and make me laugh too. This eases some of the anxiety and has been a big help at getting me to realize that some reactions you just can’t help and need to take in stride.\n\nMy suggestion is that you sit down and have that mature and calm conversation with your husband and explain all of what you told us to him. You can even just show him your post and have him read it for himself. It’s nothing to feel guilty about. We’re all human and we all find others attractive for different reasons. I bet you’ll find out that he looks at other women to but has no intention of cheating on you! It’s just normal behavior for everyone. Hiding it from him might make the situation look more suspicious than it actually is."}

Trying to wrap my head around how it went from so hot to so cold so fast.  \nEven at the start of the relationship I remember saying how intense this was and that I never met a girl before that came on so strong and into me.  \n\n\nWe met in Mid Sept - we live 2 hours apart so it was LD type but with her work schedule she is gone half the month from her home anyway so even if I lived in her city it would be semi long distance. We would always find time to hang out a good chunk of her days off / kept in touch everyday via text. Always good mornings good nights all that stuff.  \n\n\nFrom the very start she was incredibly affectionate, compliments, sweet charming more so then any typical average girl I would have recently met. Probably 15 actual days of  hanging out in person  she is telling me she loves me. at the 3 month mark or so she is hinting at wanting me to move in with Her. I wasn't quite ready for that just yet I move a lot slower then her.   \n\n\nI can tell my reluctance to move right away turned her off and she turned cold not that long after to the point of being a totally different person.  \n\n\nThe times we had were so good and so strong I am now second guessing myself big time and want to take the risk and move and try to make this work with her. But I am afraid she's already made up her mind on me. Is there anyway to salvage this? I truly believe in us and want to make this work.","completion":"That is not what love bomb is, love bomb is when someone does all these overly acts of affections to get what they want from you, often it's sex, and once they get theirs, they no longer act affectionate.\n\nWhat happens here seems to be different. She changed because of not reciprocating at her level, or the level she wants you to.\n\nHonestly, if someone does such a 180 for you evaluating first and taking it slow, I would see this as a red flag and no way I would move in till I know her better.\n\nIt could be insecurities, but even that doesn't make sense to be this sensitive. In my opinion, something is going on in her mind, where she might think you do not love her as much as she does... And that mindset is a red flag, because it would tell she might never be happy if she feels in her head she loves you more than you do her.\n\nAgain, just my opinion."}

You love this person, and you share a life with her.\n\nYou have discovered, though, that the two of you are not compatible. You’re really not compatible as a couple because sex matters. And there won’t be a time in your life when sex doesn’t matter. Ever.\n\nSo here you are, faced with a big problem that’s not going away, and you know the right answer is to break up, but that’s a terrible right answer, so you start flailing around hoping there’s some OTHER right answer that’s not terrible. And you know what? There’s not. Sex isn’t going to stop mattering. Your libido will go down, but not for another 40-45 years.  Her libido probably isn’t going to change much given that she’s 21 &amp; you’ve already told her and told her what you need &amp; she’s just not into it. \n\nSo maybe you just open up your relationship! It’s perfect! You get her, AND you get all of the free sex you want! YAY! Well. Hmmm. \n\nHave you spent any time really thinking about what that would do to your relationship? You’re pretty comfortable floating this idea because you’re confident she won’t sleep with anyone else. But what if she does? Imagine that she goes out for a sex date &amp; then comes home and crawls in bed with you. Are you imagining her having sex with someone else? Think about it…How does that make you feel? So, your plan to save your relationship is to make your gf feel just like that regularly. Doesn’t really seem like a good option. Too, I sincerely doubt that you’re the kind of guy who can have sex without getting attached. So the open marriage thing is just going to make you both miserable.\n\nAnd now we’re back to the only real option being breaking up. I understand (I really do) how you feel about her and that you think there’s no possible way that you’ll ever find someone like her again. I also know that you will find someone that you’re wholly compatible with. But you can’t find her until you end this relationship.\n\nYou know, you can stay with her as long as you want, and you’re probably going to stay a few more years at least because you’re really afraid of being alone, but this relationship is going to end eventually, and it will end because of your sexual incompatibility, and you will be as miserable as you are right now until it ends.

Today i woke up surprised that she blocked me from everything , i called her from another number to see what was the issue , she said that she never wants to talk or see me again , i told her to explain why and at first she didnt want to but eventualy said that i blamed her for everything in our last break up and that i acted like an asshole when i said the things i mentionned previously . I was in shock of what i just heard , this wasnt the girl i know , she kept saying that i wasted her time and regrets even texting me , at that point i got really angry and ended up cursing and hung up the phone. Im currently drinking and smoking and throwing up everywhere ,im a mess.  I was steugglung to quit smoking and drinking but when we talked i think thats not gonna happen anytime soon . Im thinking of comfronting her in person and talk about it but im afraid she'll be aggressive and refuse to talk to me . I am deeply in love with her and cant imagine how would it be without her especially after losing hope and gaining it again just to see it all disapear again .I really dont knlw what to do and really need some advice my friend.\n\nSorry for the very long text.\nThankss!","completion":"Thanks for the response brother."}
{"prompt":"My (23f) girlfriend (23f) is blaming me for her missing clothes? We have been together a few years, she moved into my apartment and then we ended up moving together into a new apartment. We get along so well and have so much fun, I work from home and she gets home from her work a little bit before I clock out from my computer. \n\nI don’t ever touch her stuff or go through her things other than the occasional getting some medicine or visiting the weed jar! I don’t even do her laundry we each do our own laundry (washer and dryer in our apartment).\n\nShe is saying she has had 3 clothing items go missing, a pair of sweatpants, something else and a jacket.\n\nI have no idea where these items would be but she immediately resorts to asking me what I’ve done with them and when I say I truly have no clue, she says things like “who’s been up in our house” “clearly somebody is taking my shit”.\n\nI know she is insecure but I’m honestly really tired of getting accused of cheating, she has asked me before if I’m having people over at our house during the day purely out of insecurity. I just can’t hear this stuff anymore, I don’t know where her missing belongings are, I’ve never touched other peoples things, I’ve never given her a reason not to trust me, and I’m tired of fighting.\n\nI won’t lie I ordered a camera yesterday during our argument to put by the front door telling her she can set it up to her phone so she can stop accusing me of bringing people in our home. She says I might as well cancel or return it because she isn’t going to use it… \n\nThe fuck do I do?\n\nTLDR; My gfs clothes are missing and apparently either I stole them, I’m cheating and someone else stole them, but NO way could she have possibly just misplaced them, right? /s","completion":"I've had doubt but i guess thats the case , shieet\n\nThanks for your reply tho!!"}

I imagine that to be the case.\n\nIt's absolutely insane that you have even considered a \"solution\" to be ordering a camera.  Is this really how you want to live the rest of your life?

Last night she had plans for us to go visit her brother on Saturday and about an hour after she told me those plans she said, “never mind the plans for Saturday are canceled. I won’t be home Saturday night though” and left it at that. I then had to ask her why she wasn’t coming home and she told me that it was her friends birthday and she was going to spend the night with her and go drinking. She never asked if I wanted to go and today when I asked her if I could go with her she said, “my friend never invited you so I didn’t ask you, but I can ask her if you can come.” Then she told me that her friend wants it to just be her and my GF. Should I be worried?","completion":"I think she is just unrealistically afraid . Odd, she should see someone, maybe something had happened. But not anything sexual, I bet."}

We went on dates and did plenty of romantic things together. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 7 years before I started dating again. Our relationship just wasn't working for the last two years and we already went through the healing process. We 'officially' separated in September. During the girl I was dating's birthday party she introduced me to a lot of her freinds and family. My social circles have been nonexistent due to a lot of changes in my life so I couldn't introduce her to everyone because...I'm just now meeting new freinds. She's the host of a meetup group I joined to start socializing again. Anyways, She looked thought my tagged posts on instagram and saw a picture of my ex and I from November where we attended a party with a few freinds of ours. We were \"Party hugging\" (Like side arms around each other dancing) and she called these pictures \"couple-ey\" and asked a series of questions that boiled down to:\n\n1. so what are you telling her, does she know you are dating other people? \n2. have you even told other people that we were talking ? because [a friend of mine I recently met] at trivia a few weeks ago asked how i even knew you\n3. i’m just wondering if you even had plans to like progress us in any way\n4. It seems like you're over her but is she?\n5. I have trust issues, I think my mind is made up, i don't know, I don't know what to say\n\nThe answer to these are \"Yes\". I did have plans to progress us. I planned a trip for us to go on and I was going to surprise her with a necklace I've been dying to give her to start our journey into exclusivity. I ended up stopping by her apartment to deliver it to her and explained my plans and intentions. This was supposed to happen on the trip and I really believe I did all I could to show her how much I cared. She was worried about two things \n\n1. The fact that I talk frequently with my ex who I'm good freinds with (Which I was happy to cut off immediately if I was to get a chance to do so) \n2. If my intentions were matched with hers. \n\nThe reason why I didn't mention my ex is because we broke up to separate the combined identity we built together which wasn't good. It wasn't nast but we realized we needed separate lives. This is why I wanted to leave that behind me and whenever she called I would swipe up because (like her and let's say, my parents when I'm with her they aren't my priority). I know how it looks but I would have like a chance to reconcile the situation. My ex and I are over and I considered my last relationships the past. There is no romantic connection there.\n\n\nShe says at this point in time she doesn't think she can move forward with dating but that she doesn't necessarily need space and I don't have to stay away from her or stop contacting her.  It's confusing and I don't know what to do really. She means a-lot to me and Even though she said thank you to the gift, said she appreciated it  and listened to me talk about how \"I knew gifts weren't her love language and that I thought the gift would mean more during quality time\" She still seems detached. Am I missing something? A part of me is saying move on and forget her because she isn't thinking about me but I just can't believe something like this couldn't be fixed. She seems so worth it to me, but then again she was so quick to toss me aside so I don't know.\n\nIm going to be seeing her at a super bowl party this Sunday and Im not sure how to interact with her or if i even should. \n\nAny advice ?

I'm living with my mom [F42] and my \"step-dad\" [M43]. I hate him more than anything, he disrespects everyone (in the sence of he's verbally/mentally abusive to everyone, says bad things about everyone he sees), snoops through everyone's things, is the laziest person I know with very low intelligence. He doesn't believe anything you tell him and feels like the best person alive. [Pretty much narcissistic traits]. I'm scared of him. I can't stand the abuse. So I snapped at him on Christmas. It didn't make it better, it made it worse. Discussions with my mom, aunt and grandma showed me that my mom doesn't care about my feelings. I don't feel good at my home. The fear and hatred affect me mentally. It affects my relationship and affects my grades. I want out.\n\nThe second incident:\nMy boyfriend was away for a few days without his phone.

They knew I have a boyfriend. They didn't stop so I showed my boyfriend when they overstepped by saying \"I love you, but in the friends way ofc\".

Which affects my friendships.\n\nSince then the relationship doesn't feel the same. I'm not as comfortable around him as I was. He's easier annoyed. I am too.

We argue a lot in the last days about things concerning our behaviors. Which seems good, yes, but it hurts. He's driving further away from me every day. I don't feel so good around him anymore and often don't wanna hang out at all. We've been together for 1½ years.\n\nThe first incident:\nIt's impacting both my relationship and my life. I'm living with my mom [F42] and my \"step-dad\" [M43]. I hate him more than anything, he disrespects everyone (in the sence of he's verbally/mentally abusive to everyone, says bad things about everyone he sees), snoops through everyone's things, is the laziest person I know with very low intelligence. He doesn't believe anything you tell him and feels like the best person alive. [Pretty much narcissistic traits]. I'm scared of him. I can't stand the abuse. So I snapped at him on Christmas. It didn't make it better, it made it worse. Discussions with my mom, aunt and grandma showed me that my mom doesn't care about my feelings. I don't feel good at my home. The fear and hatred affect me mentally. It affects my relationship and affects my grades. I want out.\n\nThe second incident:\nMy boyfriend was away for a few days without his phone. He does that a few times a year. But it was after incident 1. I fell into a deep loneliness because my only happy place wasn't reachable. I was all on my own, trapped with my fear.

Everything but the heart was fine with me, I just ignored it tho. They eventually started to flirt with me. I talked them off by replying with things like \"uhm\" or just ignored it. They knew I have a boyfriend. They didn't stop so I showed my boyfriend when they overstepped by saying \"I love you, but in the friends way ofc\". My boyfriend got furious from the way they talked to me, I totally get why, it really wasn't appropriate. I realized it too late. It was nice to have someone care while he was away.

Your husband signed up for therapy. That's something he hasn't done before. It may be slow change. It may be too late, but you asked him to do something and he did, and at this point, don't you owe it to him to go to therapy and see if this relationship can be saved?\n\nIf you keep communicating with R, you will never work on your marriage. Hear me loud and clear. Communication with R means one foot is already out the door and you're already looking at that green grass on the other side of the fence. Years down the road if you burn it down and things don't work out with R, will you regret not having tried harder with your husband?\n\nMy advice: Stop all communication with R. Decide to wait out at least a few months of counseling before making a decision about your marriage, because if your feelings for R affect your decision, then it's not going to be a decision you can live with down the road. Clear your head. Go to counseling. THEN make a decision."}

You say that your husband seemed ambivalent about getting married.  He has issues with substance abuse and alcoholism.  He is withdrawn and avoids/ignores you.  You both walked into this marriage with your eyes closed to all of the issues.\n\nStarting therapy is the first step in what may be a long journey.  You both have issues that need to be addressed before you can make a decision about staying together or divorcing.  Marriage, and long-term relationships in general, take work.  Life is messy and can throw lots of curves at you.  You're going to go through a lot of good times and bad times.  There will be days that you're stressed and can't be a great partner, and your spouse will have those times too.  You need to learn how to navigate those times and give each other some grace.  And you need to lean how to communicate effectively to deal with everything that comes your way.\n\nOne thing is certain - you need to break off the relationship with R and give yourself time to work on your own issues.  Right now, R is a distraction and a fantasy.  He seems like the perfect partner when compared to your husband, but you don't really know him that well, and everyone has flaws.  Also, if you don't address your own issues (falling in love too quickly, ignoring red flags in the relationship, anxious attachment) you're going to be repeating the same mistakes in any of your romantic relationships.\n\nMy advice is this: work on yourself first.  If your husband is making a serious effort, give it some time to see if both of you can make enough progress to salvage your relationship."}

{"prompt":"Parents against a multi-religious relationship of me (F26) and my partner (M29) I (F26) have been with my partner (M29) for some time but my parents are opposing my relationship due to religious differences. My partner is Muslim and my parents are Christian. Neither my partner and I are religious and his parents are okay with our relationship. I kept it secret from my father, but when I told him about it, he threatened that he would go to his parents, and do something (he was very vague) if I really didn’t end my relationship, and how I don’t know the things he is capable of. This is very difficult for us, but neither I nor my partner lives in the same country as our families. I don’t know if the solution is just to lie and say that I broke up and continue our relationship a secret.\n\nThis is a big problem because other than being islamophobic, my father was a great dad and supported me a lot to get my education abroad and he really did his best in all other domains. I love him and my mother, but they are old people whose opinions won’t change. So I can't hope that they will come to terms with it.\n\nMy father got very sick after he found out, went to the ER numerous times and has heart problems (he is also a cancer survivor) and my mother also has a history of heart attacks in her family. I know that they really love me a lot and are afraid that being in this relationship would mean that my partner's family would require me to convert (which they 100% wouldn't). He is also opposed to the idea of communicating with my partner or his parents. He is really torturing my mom and younger brother and he is always talking about how this will cost him his life. I feel so powerless and I really don't want to be the cause of their unhappiness.\n\nI am afraid because it is not a question of me being disowned; I am afraid that if I choose my partner, he might do something to his family or himself, or my family. I am also really in love with my partner and sure of our relationship. He also feels okay that we keep our relationship under the radar because we would rather stay incognito than break off the relationship. However, I am afraid that this might not be a sustainable solution and that they would be furious if they found out and that the consequences would be grave.\n\nIf anyone has any pieces of wisdom to share, please let me know. At this moment, I would appreciate anything.","completion":"I hate posts like these for this post OP you were 32 and she was 19 when you started to live together and now all of a sudden your finding issues man i wonder why also she i feel bad for her she came from a messed up family which probaly left her with a lot of issues and instead of being able to deal with them she gets preyed upon by a 32 year old predator who took advantage of her issues to get with her i would really like to know w these reasons you can't separate  maybe she is finally realizing the monster you are \n\nAlso how long did you know her before you two got together"}

I have no shame to say that she is harder, tougher and brighter than me.\n\nHer autonomy has always been the aim.

What I’ve heard as a solution is you guys have to make an effort to take time for each other, which is why I suggested dates. If she moves out you’re going to have much less time to get to know each other as dating with a newborn is much different (and more difficult) than dating while single. Pick a night a week where after baby goes to bed you take some time to do something as simple as have a late candle lit dinner and talk to each other about things that aren’t the baby. Once a month hire a babysitter and have a night out to do something you both enjoy. Take time for each other."}

That’s just not reasonable. Maybe it is if the people in question have exactly the same schedule and sex drive and likes and dislikes. But if that’s not the case, then at least one of them will, A: be sexually frustrated sometimes, or B: have to get satisfaction using something/someone other than their partner. And unless that was laid out at the beginning of your relationship as a hard boundary not to be crossed, then it’s not exactly fair to make it a boundary at this point and expect him to change.\n\nYou are not in competition with the internet. Think of it this way: would you eat only your favorite food for every meal every day? No. That doesn’t mean it’s not your favorite or that another food will replace it as your favorite. It just means that not all of our wants and needs can be satisfied from one single source all the time."}
