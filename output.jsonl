I've been with my gf for 6 years and we've been friends with other guy for about 4 years.\n\nWe were at his place partying with people including his girlfriend drinking and doing lines when it got late and people started dwindling. The girlfriend of the \"friend\" went to bed early then we were out at the back table with 4 of us.\n\nThey were hugging which I didn't think was too weird and then she started rubbing his back but I'm not a JEALOUS person so I didn't say anything. I went inside to get another shot then I come back. 5 minutes go by I think they're in the toilet which is closed but the light under the door is on. After 5 minutes I open the door and no one's there so I use it. Then after another 5 minutes I go look for them and I hear sex sounds upstairs. Her sex sounds. But I think maybe she's up in the other toilet upstairs and he woke up his gf and got it. I go back downstairs. After another 5 I go back up and open the door. The room is dark and he pulls his pants up and she hides behind the door I just open.\n\nI go back downstairs. Go to the other guy at the table and say I'm leaving then I go to the other room, grab my bag and then go outside to my car and drive home about 2km away. When she gets home she's crying saying she didn't remember and then I say tomorrow we need to sort out belongings but she leaves then and stays at another friend's place.\n\nThe next morning I get texts saying they were doing lines and then he needed to piss so turned the light off to protect his modesty and she says she didn't have sex and her clothes were on and she wishes she didn't hide behind the door. The next day.\n\nOn top of that she tries to say she followed me but I had gone except I made like 3 stops to say bye to the other guy and grab my things so they didn't chase me down straight away.\n\nThey don't address her sex sounds which I know, they're distinctive.\n\nThey're definitely lying right? Am I being gaslit? It doesn't take that long to do a line and piss and sex sounds","completion":"I mean, dude, it smells like chicken, tastes like chicken, look like chicken, maybe.. its chiken? \nShe 100% cheated on you, and she didnt even have the decency to admit it and be sorry, if you dont leave this girl and \"friend\" you were victim of the gaslight of the century"}

Doug isn’t a close friend of mine at the program, I’d say we’re friendly acquaintances.

I really don’t think that’s true. He said if he found out about this from another source, he’d suspect cheating. \n\nI’m at a loss.

Aside from everything other people are writing, I would like to give you a different perspective. If he was so sleepy that he fell asleep while you were talking on the phone, maybe you caught him at a bad time during his sleep cycle (also depending how easy it is for him to wake up), maybe he was so groggy he didn't realize what was happening. My bf gets like that when he is awoken during sleep. will tell me he will do x in just a minute, maybe even start doing it but falls asleep because he was basically sleeptalking. Do you really think he went to sleep on purpose, so he didn't have to listen to you? You know him better than any of us. How supportive is he aside from that? Does he listen to you when you are both well-slept and awake? is he giving you support now? If he is unsupportive like that, there is no point staying with him.\n\nI have had a bad situation before where my bf and I where in different time zones and I felt I didn't get the support from him, the way I needed it in that moment (admittedly, I asked via text, he was asleep and didn't read the message until 6 hours later), distance makes things harder. Do you think he would have given you a hug and held you, listened to you, had you been right there in front of him? \n\nUnfortunately, we cannot expect others to do the same as we would. In this situation, I would be wide awake on the phone, but I am 100% sure my bf would be like your bf. But I know he is supportive when he is awake and alert, so I accept that part of him. If that is a deal-breaker for you, then you need to find someone who can give you that.\nI think focus on getting the support that you need now, and talk about this situation when you are feeling less emotional about it."}

{"prompt":"Today my (25f) husband(24m) not so nicely told me he isn’t attracted to me anymore and implied a lot of our martial issues would be resolved if I lost weight. What am I supposed to do now? We met in high school &amp; have been together for 6 years. I’ve always been overweight but when we met I was at the healthiest I’ve ever been. I still wore XL clothes but I was overall fairly fit and I exercised regularly. After our relationship got serious we moved in together and I picked up his unhealthy habits. We were eating almost identical shitty diets, but I gained a lot of weight and he only gained a little. Now I wear 3x clothes and it’s been impossible for me to prioritize my health because I have a lot more responsibilities and obligations than I did 6 years ago (btw since then I’ve been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder which explains why I gained weight so easily.) He insinuated he doesn’t even like to look at me anymore and I have noticed he has been treating me differently. I still enjoy going out, getting active, and doing activities but now I’m so embarrassed I don’t even want to leave my house. What do I do?\n\nAdding more context to the post because this got way more attention than I expected: I appreciate the kind comments and advice. I really do want to better myself and I can understand gaining a considerable amount of weight can change a relationship, but he had only ever complimented me, so I didn’t realize it was such as issue for him until yesterday. After he told me how he felt I asked him if he would be willing to take on some household duties so that I could have time to focus on myself (I work, take care of the house, and I’m a full time student with lots of homework) and he was very resistant to the idea. I ask him to join me on my walks (having him with me motivates me to walk faster/longer) but he tells me walking isn’t exercise because he only sweats if he runs. I’m really struggling between standing up for myself and being understanding of his preferences and feelings…","completion":"Not only is this definitely sexual assault but her history of increasingly hassling you when you're tired or not in the mood is also waaay over into unacceptable behavior.

Shows of violence are to protect your ego, not to protect your girlfriend. They demonstrate a loss of control which is why they make people uncomfortable. They are not the best way to resolve most situations, usually only escalating the drama and negativity and consequences, which is why people call you the problem. You can be assertive and refuse to take shit without being violent. No one should opt for violence when the situation does not require it."}

I asked him what's wrong and he said \"there's something that I didn't tell u but my parents are getting a divorce\" and he's feeling awful about it and he disappeared after that for couple of weeks no calls nothing. \nThen he suddenly called me he said he's back and i was so happy, we met and we hang out for two weeks, everything was back to normal. \nThen he left again without a goodbye or anything, he said he's mom called and he has to go. He literally told me this via voice note. And he disappeared again. It's been 6 weeks now no calls nothing. He only sent me two voice notes since he left. He said he's going through a lot and he doesn't want to talk. He also said he doesn't now when he's coming back and \"I'll talk to you later after I'm done with all this\". \nI tried to call him a lot. I left him bunch of messages saying I love him and I'll wait for him no matter what, he just need to talk to me and not ghost me like this. I also said if he want to break up I'll understand, he just need to say something but he's not talking. He's not doing anything. He read my messages and doesn't response. And I'm sad and hurt coz this guy was the sweetest and he'd never hurt anyone and now he's doing this and I'm not sure what to do I love him so much and I told him he's worth waiting for and I'll support him no matter what.. but he's not saying anything....","completion":"Well, she is lying, so there's that.

We did, cracked the window the tiniest bit to let air in, and I started to get really nervous and anxious. We were having sex for a a few minutes and then I started second guessing, I was really into it and then got nervous and asked him if people were walking by every once in a while. I ended up getting in my own head about it and asked him to stop a few times. He didn’t. I ended up just letting it happen and kinda got into it again at the end after I calmed down a bit but it felt weird afterwards. And I immediately confronted him about it saying that I told him to stop and asking why he didn’t. He said he thought I was just nervous about there being people but he was keeping an eye out. I told him it didn’t matter and that he should have stopped anyways and I cried. He felt really bad. We both feel awkward talking about it now and when I bring it up it feels sad and awkward. \n\nHe’s a nice person with a really kind heart and I have trouble thinking that he did assault me.. but I keep thinking about it and it’s been months. I wish I could stop thinking about it.\n\nI want to be with him. I love him. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if it was rape.","completion":"OP, I already read the comments and your replies and since I don't want to repeat any of the smart things already said, I just want to talk about something that seems small, but stuck out to me: Your wife exploring the possibility of having \"psychic powers\", and, a tiny bit, gaming. \n\nYour wife sounds, overall, like a grounded person. You said the stressful job she quit involved sick people, so I assume that she believes in modern medicine and the like. You also expressed in a comment that you are pretty baffled where this came from.\n\nI think it basically came from a place close to where the gaming comes from: Fleeing from reality because of great unhappiness. Games distract you. They put you into an interactive world which isn't sucky reality, but where you can, no matter what sort of game you play, win. \n\nPsychic powers would be an equally cool win. Imagine you would have the magic powers to make all your problems go away! No matter what psychic powers she thinks she may have, it's bound to be useful. Read minds? Magically move objects around? Talk to ghosts? Heal people? All of that can definitely be used to earn money easily. It also implies doing things \"easily\" - just think about something and it's done. No stress, no exhaustion. Easier. Happier. Bound to get her admiration and attention. Everything reality doesn't seem to be right now.\n\nDon't we all dream like that sometimes, in good and bad ways? Don't we imagine what we would buy if we suddenly had a million dollars? Don't we something think if it wouldn't be cool if the horrible boss we hate would just fall down the stairs and break his neck, never to bother us again? Don't we dream our dead loved ones would come back and hug us one more time when we are miserable? Don't we imagine how it would be to constantly live in the place we have a wonderful vacation at? In my opinion, her sudden dreams of psychic powers come from such a place. And the fact that she is actively trying to believe in it shows, in my opinion, how deeply unhappy she is. She is clinging to something so crazy to escape her current life because she sees no other way out. She's stuck. Miserable. And you, the one around her, are the one feeling her misery. The more miserable she gets, the more you feel her unhappiness. \n\nThe question is: Where does that misery come from? Is it because you kind of dragged her down because you are cranky? Is she actually suffering from depression because she is now at home so much and lacks the social interactions with coworkers?\n\nOr, maybe, it's because she doesn't really know what to do, job-wise. Maybe she doesn't feel like anything is fun, after having had two jobs she quit and also not really feeling like turning a hobby into a career (which is often smart - having to do something for a living can suck all joy out of it and creativity is hard to force when you don't feel like doing it). Maybe she tossed herself into the \"role\" of your caretaker simply because it meant that she could forget about the job thing for a while - and then, instead of being happy with that, you put the finger into the wound by telling her that she needs to worry less about you and more about what she needs to do with her life. Maybe worrying about you was her way to escape that needed thought.\n\nI personally would recommend therapy. Both couples counselling since it's clear that you two right now drag each other down and your communication got lost somewhere along the way, but also individual counselling for her. Gaming and psychic powers point me towards a depression at least brewing in the background and I feel like a neutral party could also help her sort herself out so that she can decide better what she wants out of life."}

I'm devastated and I have never posted anything on reddit.\n\nMy bf and I have been dating for almost a year, we met through a dating app and it was a long distance relationship. We are Persians (in case it matters). Almost 3 months into our relationship, I found out that he was cheating on me with a Mexican girl. I forgave him as he told me that she was from a different country and would never marry her and he swore that he left her. In turns out he told her that he left me (so basically continued using her for sex). We both believed this liar! He continued sleeping with her and eventually he run away from her. She called me and told me that they were still together and were sleeping for another 2 months. After giving him a second chance, he moved in with me for a month. We lived together happily ever after, despite always having doubts that he was talking to others.\n\nHe moves to a different state for a job, Ohio and his ex gf calls him and cries because he left her and run away from her. He keeps talking to her behind my back and buys her a ticket to come visit him. I find out about it and he tells the ex gf not to come and blocks her. She still desperately shows up and stays with him for a week- despite, me calling his friend and all 4 of us having a big fight and me telling him to kick her out and he claimed it was 2 AM and he was gonna sleep on the couch and would kick her out the following day. I got super angry and changed my phone number. He was GONE for a week as she refused to leave his place and wanted to leave on her original flight day. Once she left, he kept emailing me and I forgave him again!\n\nI forgave him like a fool, a month later we find out the ex gf is pregnant (she removed her IUD and didn't tell him). I found out and I still stayed with him because I loved him to death and he was never going to be with her as she has 2 older children from different men and he refused to be involved in this child's or her life. She decided to keep the baby.\n\nWe have been having fights for the last 4-5 months because I remind him on daily basis that he cheated on me and remind him of her.....

{"prompt":"How do I (26M) tell my wife (24F) nicely I think she needs to lose weight? My wife and I have been together since high school, married since she was 18. She has genetics that make her hold her weight more, but overall we live relatively healthy lifestyles. I understand her weight isn’t because of some obsessive eating or gross behaviors, just genetics. \n\nThe last year specifically she has gained massive weight, and while I’m still attracted to her I can tell it’s getting less and less the more weight she gains. It isn’t just because of her weight (though her weight does cause these other issues), she also has had bad skin issues due to her weight. She has had multiple body issues as well due to her weight, and had surgery as an indirect result of her weight (part of the reason I want to talk to her, I wouldn’t solely on my attractiveness). \n\nI’ve never confronted her about her weight, and I know she cares and is sensitive about it because she implements her nutritionist’s recommendations into her diet, and she lightly works out (twice or three times a week). How to I tell her I think she needs to put extra focus into losing weight and getting healthier? Any suggestions?\n\nEdit: just adding some basic info, she’s gained 100lbs in the past year and a half and is 450 lbs now at 5’5”. I’m worried about her health as well, as she has been following her nutritionist for the past two years but still steadily gaining weight. I’m confident she isn’t binge eating or eating anything besides what’s recommended. When she works out it’s two or three days every week but only 10-15 mins, so that’s the area where I think if she could work on she could at least stabilize, if not lose weight.","completion":"If she's going to a nutritionist and is implementing and following their recommendations, is working out, and already cares about weight loss, it sounds like she is already putting lots of focus on this. What else would you like her to do? Sounds to me like she's taking all the right steps.\n\nIn my opinion, this conversation you want to have with her, especially in the context of being less attracted to her, will only cause her emotional harm (which could hinder progress versus encourage it). If she wasn't already focused on weight loss and health, I would encourage you to bring up the conversation very gently. But in this case, she IS focused on it.\n\nMy advice would be to encourage her in what she is doing. Cheer her on! Tell her how proud you are that she is focusing on this.\n\nIf things are getting to a point where this is impacting you staying in a relationship with her, then yes, obviously you have to have a conversation (but don't threaten her with leaving, that's manipulative—bring it up as a critical concern or just leave, but never use it as an \"if you don't do x, I'll leave\" threat). But be ready for her to potentially leave or react poorly if you do have this conversation, because that is a huge bomb to drop and BOTH partners deserve not only to be attracted to their partner but to also feel that they are attractive."}

I 100% GUARANTEE 100lbs in two years is not just genetics. Something is going on. Binge eating, depression, hormone imbalance, illness, secret eating, general continuous overeating, severe stress. Be empathetic and encouraging as she figures out what the root cause is and remind her she can confide in you without judgment. Weight gain, food, and disordered eating (not saying this is what's happening, just pointing it out) all carry A LOT of shame.

The counselor said it will take a gigantic effort on her part to work throughout therapy to get out of it (1-2 years) and only she can do it to change it.

{"prompt":"My wife (32F) &amp; I (30M) are having issues with our sex life, should I be worried? First off, I apologize for improper punctuation and sentence structure, thanks for reading and keeping that in mind.\n\n**TLDR**: My wife and I haven't had sex in over 3 years. We used to have sex (not much) before we got married and now it's literally impossible to convince her to do it. Her typical reasonings are \"I'm tired\" or just blatantly ignores the advance. When we did have sex (a handful of times...) it was always a chore... and never ended with any good orgasm. She usually said \"it hurts\" or \"ow\". Mind you I was NOT going hard or fast or anything. It's like trying to move a mountain getting her aroused (impossible) no matter what I did she wouldn't get wet. What should I do?\n\n So a little background on me before I met my wife; I was an extremely sexual active guy, with all of my past relationships I would have sex at least 5-10 times a week. All of my partners would have no problem with it, they to were just as engaged with the sexual advances as I was. I'm not some sort of supermodel, extremely yoked, rich guy either. I am of average looks, tattooed out the wazoo (minus hands and above the neck), I don't have a massive **shlong** (above average), middle class dude. I was worldly, as in traveled all over before I moved to Japan to live, where I met my wife after a year of living there.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for 7 years now, married for 5. I am American, she is Japanese. Our first year together (living in Japan), it was awesome, traveled a lot, experienced so many things together and were practically happy all the time. Mind you, we did have our typical \"couple arguments\", but it always was resolved and we moved on fine. Now throughout our first year of being together we didn't rush into having sexual relations. It started off as business and client, then to friends, finally to dating. We didn't have sex for the first 6 months. Then we ventured into progressing our relationship further.\n\nI will say that our first time having sex was normal, she got aroused just fine and was just as into as I was. The relationship grew closer of course, so about a year later I asked her to marry me, she said \"of course\". Sex life was still present, but I started to notice things like she would say \"ow\" a lot, so I would be very slow and conscious of my actions, regardless it would always be \"Ow\". I thought it wasn't a big deal maybe it's just because we were doing it too much or what-have-you.  \n\nFast forward to getting married, I had to move to the States due to my business expanding and family (stateside) tragedies. So, we discuss this she decided she will move with me and quit her very successful career in business district Tokyo. We begin the process of applying for a green card. I move stateside and buy a house and continue working on the business and immigrations. 2 years into our marriage she finally gets her visa. She moves all her earthly possessions to America to be with me. During our extended period apart we would facetime everyday multiple times a day and \"sext\" or \"facetime sext\" (? I don't know how to explain this part haha) so we were excited to finally get to have sex again. Anyways, we finally get down  to it, mind you I did not rush into this it was like a week or two before I suggested the idea, she agreed. That was the last time we actually had what I would consider sex, and it wasn't fulfilling at all for either of us.. she had a very hard time getting aroused, and no matter what I did as soon as I touched her down below she would say \"ow\". So since that was what happened she then offered to just give me blow jobs or just let me masturbate with her naked or whatever. I made due, I had a ever growing sexual drive that just couldn't be satiated. \n\nNow, fast forward to current time line, we haven't had successful sex since then. Sure there were intermittent times when she would blow me, or I would just rub one out. But now I'm a bundle of pent up sexual stress and have been having **adulterous thoughts, borderline porn addiction, putting blame on her for \"underperforming\" (** I understand that's not okay trust me I feel bad, I just get so frustrated I feel like I'm to blame). So, recently I have noticed within the past few months whenever we are sleeping and I go to hold her boobies her **nipples will be hard, but as soon as I put my hand on her boobs, they go soft**... I have also noticed that **NO MATTER WHAT I DO TO GET HER AROUSED SHE'S DRIER THAN THE DESERT AND WILL NOT GET WET. Whenever I suggest we try to have sex, she gets an upset stomach and actually has diarrhea.**  \n\nAnd NOTE: She has shown no other signs of her cheating on me, she has a full greencard (she refuses to get American citizenship when asked about it), still hasn't left me even when I was at my lowest point in life and tried to divorce her she refused, and even after I've had 2 strokes and 5 heart surgeries she still takes care of me and shows an extraordinary amount of love for me except when it comes to sex.\n\nSO here are my questions:\n\n* What do I do to help her become aroused again?\n* Why does her nipples go soft after I touch her boobs?\n* Why does she say \"Ow\" whenever I try touching her vagina?\n* Should I be worried?\n* Is there something wrong with me?","completion":"Has she seen a doctor?"}

Sorry I should add this we have been together for five years and talked marriage and kids and I was hoping to propose this year. He said I really am not on her level and am not doing enough to support her. Adding that he doesn’t want to see me heart broken and to prepare as it is inevitable. He said that she deserves a bigger house and she’s always stressed and I’m not eliminating that as there is housework to do when she gets home. Yeah her job can be super stressful as she’s a scientist right now but I feel I am always there. Sorry to add my dad owns our house and is my neighbor.

And from what *you yourself describe*, I can see why. Her actions suggest she is controlling and somewhat toxic. The first two years (!!) were a disaster by your own words. Your friends probably wonder why you are still with her. Friend does not like her, for legitimate reasons, and therefore doesn't want her at her wedding. Fair enough.\n\nIs it 'disrespectful'? Which is a word that has lost all meaning but that aside.... I'd say No, it's not. GF has done nothing to earn any respect to begin with, so there's that.\n\nGo to the wedding and learn what this lesson is trying to teach you."}

I don't make him watch this kind of stuff with me and I learned to keep my random informations to myself, since he doesn't like random informations.\n\nSo, it's my hunger for information really unhealthy?\n\nPs: My bf is a gamer and he knows a lot of stuff about certain games, like knowing animals names on Arc, which ones can be tamed, some curiosities about games he does likes...he also is making characters and creating a completely new of his own, that I absolutely love.

This is simply something you enjoy doing and has become a hobby for you, and newsflash hobbies don’t always have to be something that makes you a better person or keep you informed on real world information. I think looking up conspiracies on games is healthier than looking up real world conspiracies anyway.

To you, your family, your friends, Luna?\n\nSince, I assume your GF has been \"attempting\" to right the wrongs of your first 2 years, is her behavior/change significant enough for forgiveness?

I moved out of state after college for work, and maintaining close familial relationships over the years has proved to be difficult, particularly with my sister, who is eternally “busy”. \n\nMy father (M86) passed away last July , and his will left everything in equal parts to me  and my sister, and named her as executor.

My sister was supposed to transfer the vehicles to our names, which involved filing a single piece of paper with the DMV within 120 days of my father’s death, but she “didn’t have time” to do it. This has turned what should have been a simple process into a bit of a nightmare, complicated even more by me living in another state. I am planning to fly down there in a few weeks to pick up the truck and drive it back. In the meantime I’ve been calling, texting and emailing her trying to figure out how we transfer the title. She ignores my texts and emails, and never returns my calls.

X and I have also become good friends over the years.\n\nLast month X and my BF went to Alaska for their mutual friend's wedding. My BF's invitation was only for him and taking a guest wasn't allowed so I couldn't go. Both were supposed to only go for 2 days but ended up staying for 5 additional days as neither of them had gone to Alaska.\n\nYesterday X called me to hang out and told me that during their trip to Alaska, she saw my BF making out with another girl and disappearing for a while at the party their mutual friend hosted.

There's already trust issues which is going to stress you out to the max. Get a paternity test and if it is yours you should consider turning this into a fwb thing. I would never encourage breaking up a family but she's not giving me faithful vibes and you will have access to her for the child. If you decide to break up try to make it not a nasty one because nothing is worse than breaking up with someone and you end up the one suffering and missing them and wondering what they are doing when they are the ones that fucked up. Life is crazy man. If the baby is yours take care of your business on that part. She's a grown woman and she knows what she is doing but I say bring up your concerns anyway and see how she responds.

It was the worst day of my life, as I watched him pass away suddenly and didn't have time to prepare mentally. He was the closest brother to me. I have three other brothers. Two of them are long distance and there's a huge age gap so we've never been close. And the other brother, we can't stand each other. (Long story). I have a pretty good relationship with the rest of my family; parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. But every since lost the closest brother to me, it feels like I don't have any siblings at all.\n\nMy boyfriend has a really close relationship with his sister, and on the surface, I'm really glad he has that. I know how beautiful that relationship can be because it's very similar to the one I had with my brother. However, deep down, there are a ton of emotions that I can't express to anyone.\nI'm so confused about why I feel so angry inside sometimes. When he tells he stories about them hanging out, or when I see them joking with one another, or just doing anything really, I get emotional. I'll step away and bawl my eyes out in the bathroom, or after I get off of the phone with him, I'll cry myself to sleep. Also, I feel guilty because sometimes I get angry out of nowhere. To him, it looks like I'm being moody or distant. But inside, I'm a mix of sad, angry, jealous, and resentful. I feel so childish and disgusting for having these feelings but I literally cannot turn them off. I don't know what to do.

{"prompt":"me (30M) and Wife (31F) Been together for 10yrs she has been controlling and I just noticed the red flags of the past :/ , started to stand up to things and now we live in resentment. also arguing about a trip. Think i gotta leave but don't want to(got a toddler) Hey  there just tryna get some opinions. Ive been with my SO for 10 yrs now  and for a while ive been very passive with her controlling behavior but  its worked out. shes always been opinionated, and spoke freely but has  always been aggressive and controlling with everything. Over the last  recent year or so its started to get to me and i often have flashbacks  of things shes done that have been red flags over the years and i resent  her for it alot. She notices but i feel so deep in it now i dont even  argue or talk about things anymore. i just shutdown and go on with my  day while she seethes on her own.\n\nA  little background: we moved cross country and have a toddler now. We've  been through alot together but now that i'm having realizations about  our past i notice most of the hard work or problems were put on me to  handle. Shes told me not to hang out with people because they treat me  like a door mat. Talks about how my family is always talking down to me  and blames everything and everyone else for our problems. I've been  shown warning signs and people have also told me about these things in  the past and i chose to stay.\n\nRecently  weve been having alot of fights because I tell her that shes not  pulling her weight. She hasnt worked in a few years, she doesnt drive,  barely cleans, doesnt do her own laundry, hasnt contributed to bills for  years and wants to travel all the time. she does find things on market  place that are nice but i always mention if she worked we would have  more $ in the bank. I dont want to keep bad mouthing as im hoping for a  unbiased opinion though i think i havent done well in creating that.\n\nanyway i can keep going on more but want to get to the point.\n\nNow  we just had a argument because she wants to travel for some free stay  IHG timeshare. (Ironically when she was getting hooked by the sales  person about 2 year ago i insisted on not taking the deal because it  wasnt financially feasible with a baby on the way. she did it anyway and  ofcourse that was a fight). anyway fast forward the time has come up to  book this trip or we will lose out on $200.\n\nWe  literally just took a trip 2 weeks ago that cost me a little over $1000  considering travel expenses and all that. Traveling is so annoying with  her. She is a late packer and late waker upper, always needs things and  over packs and always forgets things too. I known this from previous  travels and i always get anxious cause of these things because they  always happen without falter. Now with a kid its more annoying. She  always gets angry cause im upset when we travel and says i get angry and  anxious. I tell her everyone does but she makes me very anxious due to  these things.\n\nSometimes i wish i  can travel without her honestly. anyway since i foot the bill everything  falls on me, mind you i dont have a great job, just enough to get us by  and have a little extra. she doesnt drive either so im chauffeur  everytime and because of her tardiness im babysitting most mornings.  Also we have dogs! guess who takes the dogs out and feeds them every  day.\n\nAnyway, point is I dont want  to go. I made it clear it was going to cost too much with the flight,  car rental, food and whatever else we choose to do. Also the pet care we  would need because of flying out. The stress of thinking of all this  has automatically put me in a NO especially cause again im paying, im  driving. she wanted to sit down and talk about how much it would cost  and making a plan but i told her I dont like travelling with her and I  didnt want to spend over a grand again on a trip when we just took one. I  would love to go but the truth is the idea of traveling with her is a  nightmare especially after this last time, i told myself i wouldnt do it  again.\n\nI dont know what to do or  say now. She is mad at me and told me were going to lose our 200 but i  really dont care, its worth it to me. shes very upset and isnt talking  but im so used to it im not bothered. I think im at my end of the rope  with this and its heartbreaking but im just zombie mode because i love  my kid. Ill live miserable as long as i can raise my child but i dont  think thats healthy.\n\nTLDR: Wife  wants to travel or well lose money. Just took trip that cost over a  grand and this one will too even though its months away. Travelling with  her drives me crazy and makes me anxious i dont enjopy travel at all. I  foot the bills, I drive, I physically make things happen while shutting  up. Shes controlling and like to use it to guilt trip me but ive had  enough and now she doesnt want to speak and we resent eachother.\n\nhave a kid and will stay miserable as long as im here for my child.\n\nI  dont know how to leave or talk about these things. I feel theres no  fixing at this point so im just  begrudgingly moving through life for my  child.\n\nI dont know how to tell  her i dont want to do this trip either as i know she is going to keep  bringing it up and getting mad at me.\n\nany advice on any of this is welcome. I know whats going on but its hard to make moves when you have nobody to speak to.","completion":"Don't get sucked into arguments.

Like I showed her a picture of my friends new bf and it was a black guy. She looks at picture and asks me if my friend has a dad. And I said no and she just shrugged her shoulders and kept eating. Hit me later it might be racism.\n\nAnother thing, this couple that lives across the street from one of her parents' businesses yelled at her for always parking on the sidewalk even tho admittedly no one uses it. They said they're gonna start reporting her. Now this couple has a disabled son and they built an outside lift thing on the side of their house for him. The next morning I found out they got fined for having it put up and had to take it down.\n\nI ask her if she reported it and she just said hey I was worried about the kid, what if it wasn't built properly. \n\nAnd just this week something really weird happened. This guy has been complimenting me at the gym. I told him I'm taken but he keeps doing it, he's married. I randomly mentioned this to my gf. And she just kinda gave me the side-eye. And yesterday I see her Instagram following jump from 40 to 41. Weird because she never uses insta, has a private account and only has 1 picture. \n\nFound out she followed the guy's wife. I ask her about it she says they started a conversation at a coffee shop randomly and started talking. Has nothing to do with the guy... I ask her if she'll tell her about his actions she says no. I ask her if she's gonna hook up with her and she says fuck no wtf is wrong with you can't I have friends...\n\nAnd I just know she's plotting something. I'm starting to get worried idk maybe I'm being silly.","completion":"I'm going to say this is fake because of the obvious red flags.  Is this some kind of writing assignment?"}
{"prompt":"[28f] My bf [24m] saved nudes sent to him from his old fwb/best friend We’ve been dating for about 5 months and his best friend/co-worker/old fwb who was the main person to encourage us to date has been apparently continuing to send him nudes/videos throughout our relationship, even though I had previously told my bf that I would be uncomfortable if they continued to be flirty with each other while we were dating. \n\nHe says it only happened two or three times, and that he didn’t think too much about it because they both just view it as any other nude found on the internet. Admittedly though, he said he feels really bad and stupid for thinking it’d be okay, but honestly I’m having a hard time believing that. \n\nFor more context:\nI found out because I opened his phone (he gave me the password on his own pretty early on) to take a picture. I know he has a photo folder of regular pics/selfies of me, so i went to find that first, but at the folder next to mine “recently saved screen-capture” the thumbnail was a picture of boobs. Honestly figured it was just porn, but I clicked it because I was curious to know what he was into. Turns out he’d screen recorded a video of the bestie’s boobs that she had sent him just a week before. \n\nAdmittedly I could have and maybe should have stopped there, but I was shocked and upset, so I went to their instagram messages (since that’s where it looked like it was from) to see if that was normal?? Turns out almost all of their interaction on there is just sending links and videos to porn or hot instagram videos/posts. The other 15-20% were voice memos and pics/videos sent back and forth that couldn’t be reopened, so who knows what was sent.\n\nWhen confronted about the saved photo his first reaction was to say “Yeah I tried to tell her not to do that”, but when I pointed out that it had been saved, he backtracked a bit then apologized.\n\nHe seems extremely apologetic and remorseful. Said that if I asked, he would completely distance himself/block her from everything. I mean..they still work together, so it’s not like “distance” is completely possible, I don’t think I’d ask him to do all that anyway..? I’m just not sure what to believe or if I’m overreacting here. \n\n**TLDR: Should I break up with my boyfriend over sending and sharing porn to his ex fwb/best female friend and for receiving/saving her nudes while we are dating?**","completion":"so your BF sent around nudes/video of a woman to the guys and keeps that video on his iPad because of reasons? Pretty fucking sleazy to start if thats actually what happened..Really not much of an upgrade from your BF simply JO to other women. Actually much worse.

{"prompt":"Should I trust my gf again ? (20M) (18F) Me (20M) and my gf (18F) have been dating for about 3 months and talking for 2. Before we started talking she was talking with this other guy and things were going good with him until I stepped into the picture . I know she had slept with him while they were talking before talking to me . Long story short I didn’t know who he was until about 1 month into our relationship. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable with them talking on Snapchat and she asked if she should block him and I said yea.  She did block him on everything and that was that. I don’t go through her phone often but sometimes I do and she lets me. She has no problem giving me her phone if I ask and I have no problem giving her mine if she ask. Recently we have been fighting for under a week and actually broke up for about 4 days. It wasn’t a bad fight mainly just us being toxic / petty. During this 4 days she unblocked the guy and starting texting him lightly again. We winded up getting back together 2 days ago . I talked to the guy and he said She asked him to meet up but the guy denied it during the 4 days . He also said she said she should have been with him instead of me and her friends like her being with him instead of me. I confronted her about this and she said she was mad and just all over the place because the breakup. She told me it wasn’t the same texting him and that she only was texting him because she knew he was still there . She said she loved me and that she wants to stay with me that nothing is going to be like me . Now I understand she was mad but still I don’t know what to do . I told her block him again on everything and she did but idk my trust is still not all the way there . What should I do should I give her another chance or end it before it gets worse ?  Or should I give her the benefit of the doubt since we were technically broken up but still it’s 4 days so. Please let me know \n\nAlso in the beginning of our relationship I was still talking to other girls . She found out and was very upset and wanted to end things but I fought for her back . I committed to her and nobody else . She has never cheated on me or talked to another guy while we were in a relationship but idk my trust is still fucked up lmk .","completion":"I like that, thank you. \n\nYeah - I am prepared to be rejected.

{"prompt":"I (19M) downloaded dating apps to see if my (22M) BF was cheating. \nI (19M) have been talking to James (22M) for 5 months. Over the last couple of months I’ve had my suspicions he was cheating  due to him still having dating apps as well as him lying about things such as his location and his use of the dating apps. Recently he gave me his phone to show me a funny video and I ended up seeing a sex tape that was recent in his camera role.

In addition to these two, a dating app (Jack’d) notification appeared at the top of the screen as we watched this funny video. I respectfully confronted and asked him about the tape, guys, and the notification. His response was that the guy he made the tape with wanted him to to send it back, all the guys who messaged him on snapchat wanted to have sex with him but he denied, and he has Jack’d to check out what’s happening and be nosy, not for sexual pleasure. I was a fool and thought I’d just been paranoid and moved on from the situation. \n\nYesterday I was over his house and saw Jack’d notifications on his home screen so I decided I’d had enough.

He didn’t text the account at first so I decided to leave the room to go the bathroom. The moment I left in the room, he texted the account.

{"prompt":"M25(me)/F39(wife) when is enough I’ve tried to write this a few times but here we go. We met 4 years ago and we both worked at a grocery store as assistant department managers. I being a very young naive person when I met her has grown up a lot, but I’ve always had a problem working with significant others at work due to seeing them too much and having either life or work spill into the other so we don’t work together anymore. \n\nWe got married a year and half ago. The first year was rough(due to me being very resistant to change)We moved to a different state and bought a house and we both had decent jobs at the time but our first issue arose. Before we got married we had separate accounts but with the marriage we just combined everything. This became and issue for my wife and really created a-lot of resentment between the both of us(this is a lot better now)My resentment was due to my feelings of being over worked and under appreciated for the things I actually do. I do 70% of the work in and on the house. Cook and do 50% of the cleaning. I also bring in 75% of our total money from working two jobs. My wife used to bring in 50% of the money but when we moved she felt overwhelmed so she basically waited until a month before she quit to tell me she didn’t want to work there anymore. We’ve worked in the same industry for years and I understand it is a-lot and very demanding but I told her to wait to find an opportunity that will bring in the same amount of money but she left that job and found another job that paid half of her previous job(still currently)I was of course frustrated beyond belief only for the fact that my wife couldn’t convince that by her leaving her job that if we wanted to maintain the life we had, I would have to step up even more and bring in more money so we could live like we’re used to. But I bite my tongue as much as I could but she just kept asking me everyday for months how I felt about it. And eventually it started to boil over. How can I possibly feel differently if I have no time to think about it and truly accept it. This went on for months and we had extremely heated arguments without really seeing any real change. No matter what is said the situation sucked and I wasn’t going to change the way I felt about the situation but I made the choice everyday to ignore how I felt to make sure my wife was alright. Well maybe not the right choice because I lost bits of myself every time we would argue and I had to make a permanent change to my mind frame . \n\nI am not a perfect person and I have problems but I have spent the last 6 months truly looking at myself and seeing where I was the problem and trying to fix my thought processes to become a better person. I’ve come so far on myself but I still have a lot of room to grow but I’m better than last year. The more I work on myself I see the actions that my wife takes and I can’t agree with the way she acts anymore. She’s been hurt too much and has way to many insecurities for me as a single person to help her and keep the life that now I’m supporting. It’s too much. I’m 25 and still figuring out how things work and it takes a toll on me everyday but I’ve found ways to keep myself motivated and keep going. Until last night. \n\nMy wife texted me because she got her schedule for work and she has Valentine’s Day off(which she didn’t request off). She asked if I had Valentine’s Day off and I said no I didn’t. I’m a department manager now and I have responsibilities around holidays because I work in grocery stores and I don’t get any holidays off besides thanksgiving and Christmas which is understood but now that my wife has holidays off now and expects me to have these holidays off to spend with her which is fine if I can make it work but it doesn’t always work out. Anyways she made a couple light hearted jokes when she was at work after I told her I count get the day off but then we she got in the door from work I was cooking Dinner and she blew up on me. She’s threatened now twice to go into work and make a scene just so I could get certain days off. She threatens me with divorce maybe once a month and to take half of all my shit. I understand you say things in the heat of the moment but I don’t see how you can share a bed with someone who just told you we should get divorced and I’m taking half your shit. \n\nI’m to the point where I was researching narcissism and I thought it was all my fault but the more time that passes and the more actions I fix of my own the more I’m left with the reality that it’s not all my fault. I can’t even exist without a word coming out her mouth about whatever I’m doing.  If anyone has questions I’m more than happy to explain further in comments. There is still hope I’m just at my wits end right now. I’m tired and I just want to be left alone to do my own thing. \n\nI just feel defeated and tired. I don’t know what to do. Is it worth the effort to make work. I’m young and in shape and my wife hasn’t worked out in two years  and has gained a good 30 pounds and she’s been dealing with this rash but simple to say I’m not attracted to her like I used to be. She doesn’t put in the effort to work on her self and I’ve seen no real change in anything, yet she keeps asking for more. More time, more love and affection. She wants the house fixed up and she wants to go on vacation which is fine but to Spain for a family wedding on my side. It will cost probably 2k for the whole trip which is doable but it takes up a good chunk of our savings so it stresses me out. She wants all this stuff but is unwilling to help me at all. I just have to figure it out. But after last night I don’t even want to look at her. I feel helpless. I’m done changing and making myself better to have to share that with someone who will not do the same for me","completion":"One, google defensiveness in relationships. Defensiveness is often found when someone is insecure, it can get confused with narcissism (as narcs are often defensive) and defensiveness is way more common than narcissism.\n\nAs for the relationship, the age difference, her demanding more and giving so little, the possible defensiveness or narcissism, no one would fault you for getting a divorce. Maybe before that get some therapy for yourself to help you better unpack what’s going on and how you feel about it. From there you’ll be better able to decide if it’s worth trying to fix or if it’s best to call it quits."}

When I've brought this to his attention previously he would tell me that's his humor, and/or he thinks victim blaming is funny (example: there was a TikTok that popped up on my page that was a jubilee video of people reading people's anonymous notes out loud (cheating related) and one of the notes that was read was: \"being cheated on changes perceptions of yourself, years later I still find myself wondering what she had that I didn't and why I'll never be good enough\", my boyfriends comment under the video was \"that is correct - if you got cheated on its your fault\"). I asked him what was his mindset with making that comment, and that its hard for me to build trust when I continue to see things like that from him, that's when he said he thinks victim blaming is funny, I responded with \"I don't joke with peoples emotions\", and he responded \"I will definitely joke about peoples emotions if idc about them, the way people like to post affirmation, I like to share stuff and caption it with anti affirmation\", I responded with I told you before what I needed from you in order to built trust with you\", and he said \"why am I always explaining myself to you\". I said to him \"seeing repost shares or engagement with stuff you know I'm eventually gonna see despite your target audience, you're explaining yourself continuously because you're ignoring something I'm expressing I need, I wouldn't bring this up otherwise\". He said \"You need me to not be myself\", and I said \"I'm willing to change things about myself especially if it's hurting someone I care about. I expect you to do the same.\" anddddddd then he said \"Okay, I'm sorry.\"\n\nThat was just one example of times when he would engage with stuff on social media where I feel like I can't trust him, this most recent time is him sharing a post on Facebook of someone's that reads: \"no Facebook I don't want to add the girl I got cheated on with thank you.\", and his share response was: \"Why you mad her? You got your priorities figured out huh\". I'm not sure what he's implying by his response to that post but I feel like a broken record repeating myself that I have trust issues whenever he engages with cheating related posts.

I remember feeling like I was leading him on because I just didn’t know if I had feelings for him and I was also struggling with my sexuality and a million other things at the time. I wasn’t able to see him in person so I sent him a message saying that he was a great friend and that I really cared for him but felt like our connection was gone and that maybe it would work in the future but it just wasn’t working now. \n\nHere’s where the problem comes in. The same day I decided to break things off with him I was messaging a friend from high school. I didn’t have a crush on this girl nor did I find her attractive. I did know that she had a crush on me and I think I just really wanted that attention from a girl because I was confused about myself. After spending the last month obsessively thinking about this event, I eventually caved and requested a data retrieval from SC because I no longer had the messages. After going all the way back 3 years, I found our messages and I became flirty with this girl directly after breaking it off with my boyfriend. I mean like 3 minutes at most. I wasn’t seeking a relationship nor really anything else. She was already being somewhat flirty towards me but I don’t remember what our original conversation was about. I don’t think I intended for it to go this way but after my newfound “freedom” I decided to be a little flirty.\n\nBy flirty, I don’t mean sexting or anything inappropriate. Just stupid teenage flirty behavior. I called her pretty and we talked about what we found attractive about women. The flirtiest it got was her asking me if I had any turn ons because we were playing 21 questions to which my 17 year old brain replied “idk, neck kisses?”. That was as bad as it got. She did eventually express an interest in wanting to hang out which I wasn’t comfortable with so I messaged her the next morning and said I wasn’t interested and wasn’t gay. I apologized for leading her on and said that it was very out of character for me. That was the end of that. It was like 10 hour convo that went no where. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up getting back together a few months later and I fell head over heels for him. Idk what I was thinking then. I just remember being so self centered and having no idea who I was. I want to tell him about it because I feel so bad for flirting with a girl minutes after breaking up with him. I know he was heartbroken and even if I didn’t have feeling at the time, it was such a shitty thing to do. I feel like if I don’t tell him how, then I’m lying to him or that if I brought it up one day he’ll think it’s worse than what it was or maybe even that I hide things from him. I had honest to god forgotten about this event because I I really didn’t like her and it was just some stupid attention thing. Someone brought up her name last month and now I literally can’t stop thinking about it. I go to bed thinking about it, I wake up thinking about, I’ve cried thinking about it.\n\nMy therapist said that this sounds like a normal teenage thing to do and that I need to learn to control my obsessive thoughts but I feel like this is different. I feel like if I don’t tell him then I’m keeping it a secret. We’ve been dating now for 4 years and I feel like I owe him the honesty. Everyone else has told me to move past it, and that telling him would just hurt his feelings and maybe even make him question me for still thinking about it 4 years later.\n\nDo I tell him for honesty sake or do I keep it to myself? Should I feel as shitty as I do or was this just a mistake in my past? Everyone is telling me the opposite of what my brain is feeling. Maybe this is just karma for being such a shitty girl friend in the beginning.","completion":"Equate the dog to a child. They both require care and supervision.

Yesterday afternoon, he called on the scheduled time to break up with me. His words are scripted. It's like someone is telling him what to say. Not the way he would normally talk to me.

He showed me all the texts between him and the therapist.

She made me see that there is something not right with me and so 2 year's ago I decided to go seek help and understand myself more about why I am a colossal f*ck up that can't hold a job down, fails with finances, fails with an intimacy beyond the initial stage, fails at showing up on time and various other issues.\n\nA year later I've been diagnosed with inattentive ADHD, plus for me, I can start to understand myself more and put the right stuff in place to help me manage a bearable life. That was December. 3 weeks ago I started medication however I'm not seeing any benefit yet. \n\nI and I didn't have the best of starts in a relationship, I was a tremendous dick and wasn't considerate at all.\n\nI struggle with long stained periods with someone, anyone I'm not I'm notalkitalkinga relationship with. I stop talking, I'm in the present person and struggle with starting conversations about anything that's not happening right now or wasn't that long ago and even that is a struggle remembering stuff to talk about. The conversation doesn't even start because it's one-sided.\n\nEven when she doesn't talk to me I struggle to remember the details and previous conversations which makes it seem like I don't give a shit but I do, I do. That I now know it's because of ADHD but she says that I am now just using that as an excuse for everything. I'm not, that wasn't the goal, the goal was to understand why I am the way I am and to get help on coping methods to make this all somewhat better. But she should understand this as her son is a dud and autistic, I'm pretty sure I am autistic too but that's a different path to get a diagnosis as an adult something I have tried to get a referral for but doc refused first time waiting on a report from the adhd. Need to follow up on that.\n\nWe rarely share the same bed, her daughter who is 9 sleeps with her (stepdad) we would have thought she would be out by now. (she had cancer at the age of 5 I know things changed psychology before my wife and her during that time)\n\nBut that's the time when I open up more and become more intimate. We had great sex at the beginning. It's not about that though I just want her back.\n\nShe has a fair deal of issues, she has an extensive list of meds she takes for various conditions. \n\nWhen the pandemic hit I let her advance in her career she wanted to become a counselor, so she took the training and got promoted in her current workplace and now works with children as a counselor around our school district. I as result became more of a house husband, that is trying to break through in the online space and work from home to be here for her kids as a much as possible. I fail at that too but I can understand why now, I made some decent money during 2020 online but the business partner then had a life breakdown of his own and started scamming people behind my back using the brand, that business obviously came crashing down fast and I've struggled mentally and physically to get past that and procrastinated a lot because of that. \n\nShe ended up needing to take a second job to bring in some more cash, 3 days a week in an evening as a texted based counselor online from home 3hrs a night. \n\nI took up driving for takeaways to bring in some cash whilst I build up the business that still isn't producing cash. That job means I'm out of the house 5-6 nights a week for 6-7 hours. Meaning I get home around 12 - 1am need to get to sleep and be up for 7-7.30 to sort the kids out. I pretty much leave when she gets home they might be an hour or two before I go. \n\nI struggle with the general house work as every adhder does, the house needs decorating and fixing up, she's been on my case about that for year's, I've slowly started now though. It's slow because that takes up so much of my mental cappicatiy. The house isn't the best at times, a bit messy when I've proitised other things and stuff. I need a \"lazy day\" at times, where I'm pretty much dead and I get the bear min done, a quick vac, pots and cat litter tray cleaned along with getting the kids to school and back.\n\nThat winds her up like nothing else but to me it's needed.\n\nI used to not be able to control my anger when we'd get into arguments but I never hit her or anything like that. Just shout and slam doors but that's controlled now I haven't done that in a while maybe the odd flair up but nothing major.\n\nIt's done more of a 180 she swears and gets angry at me more now than the other way round.\n\nHer daughter is really stubborn, and I struggle at times to get her to do what is needed, my wife struggles with this too. I don't raise my voice at her because she just shuts down completely and I get your not my dad. Which is fair enough but it has meant she's been late to school and not attended at times where we are now on school attendance monitoring. It's getting better with that in place. I don't want her to suffer and I don't want my wife to get the stick for it when its her that has to go to work and pay the bills for which I'm enterally grateful for.\n\nWe had a report to social services from school because one of the daughters friends that used to come round to the house made an accusation, that my wife has been sending inappropriate images to another man and receiving them and she has seen them.\n\nObviously my wife denies this and I have no question of whether that's the truth or not that happened last Wednesday, when the said kid was supposed to be coming to ours after school but decided to run off from school before pick up time. My wife had previously said she's not allowed at our house anymore but she's said stuff like that before and has never meant it. I thought the daughter had arranged this with her mum but as it turns out not. We didn't really see each other between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. I was working everyone was asleep when I returned.\n\nI didn't even know myself until we got to school when the daughter told me about her coming. So I just went with it because she would have refused to move if I said anything otherwise. Stubborn. \n\nThis is all my fault apparently but before that Tuesday my wife came home visibly upset and fed up with everything, she spent 30 mins in the car before even stepping inside the house clearly had been crying. I tried asking her about it, I got \"I'm fine\" over and over again I had to leave for work.\n\nSince the she's avoided me and her daughter pretty as much as possible.\n\nWednesday night she locked herself in with her son and slept with him instead. Thursday she went to her friends house and came home only when I needed to leave. And Friday we had opticians for the whole family, it was hard, the daughter kicked off 3 times, 2 of the times I was the one to calm her down. After we dropped her off at her days where she was crying as she went in the house not talking or saying bye to her mum. \n\nWe got home and I had an usual Friday off, I really wanted to try repair this but she had other plans and got dressed up and went out to another friend's house and took alchol with her and didn't return home after 2am. I'm not sure how much she had to drink but she drove home and with her meds its really unpredictable how it affects her sometimes she's drunk after only a few. I was asleep. Her daughter came home at around 9pm confused to why her mother wasn't here to which I had to play with her and be with her until she was asleep. I didn't mind but it was hard when this is all going on.\n\nNow she's in her sons room again today, but I think she's asleep and struggling with her chronic fatigue.\n\nThat's not all of it, but you get a picture.\n\nI love this girl, I find her incredibly hot, I miss the intimacy and I just want her to be happier most of all. \n\nI see it all falling apart and I have no one to talk too about it.\n\nI ditched my friends because they wasn't being supportive and I would have stayed being that dick I was at the start. \n\nI've distanced myself away from my family because of other issues.\n\nAnd my wife thinks I'm just like her exes, out to make her life miserable and cause problems in her life.\n\nWhen it's the opposite I do all I can to change and better myself. But I have my struggles and limitations. \n\nI needed to write out.","completion":"I'm wondering why I can't see the other too comments."}
{"prompt":"I (F24) love my (M26) boyfriend so much but he continues to hurt me. Maybe I subconsciously like being in relationship where I’m the sub. Constantly letting him do whatever he wants and apologizing to HIM when he doesn’t live up to my standards. There are a couple incidents I want to discuss. \n\nFirst, I recently developed a stomach probably where I throw up pretty consistently every couple of weeks (CVS). My boyfriend is disgusted by this and let me know it. We had a ski trip planned and as soon as we got to our Airbnb I start throwing up. He then started yelling at me saying I’m disgusting and he knew this would happen. We then got in the car and drove back home. The whole time under his breath he is whispering “disgusting” and other things like it. Meanwhile I feel like I’m going to die. We get back to our apartment and he tells me I’m not allowed in and to go to my dads house. I asked if he could drive me and he said no. I never got an apology for this, after 2 days I came back to the apartment and we acted like nothing ever happened. I didn’t tell people because I didn’t want my family to hate him because I knew they would tell me to break up with him.\n\nThere are so many more issues but the one I’ll focus on today is that he said he would come watch me coach my gymnastics meet (I own a gymnastics gym and k coach the team.) he has never even been to the gym but claims constantly that he supports me and my business. Last night he said he would come. This morning I let him know we were leaving at 2 today and then he says “I wanted to rest today”. Mind you resting to him means driving around smoking blunts. I am now convinced he doesn’t care or love me even though there are good times. But he has me thinking I’m crazy and needy for wanting básic attention and affection. I’m so heartbroken and I’m so destroyed and he continue to think he’s in the right. He said “how do you have the audacity to come at me right now when all I do is support you”. I can’t think of one things he’s done to actually support me other than occasionally telling me I’m doing a grear job with my business. He says he loves me when he’s in a good mood but this isn’t love. I could never treat someone who I loved this way.

In fact, break up with him before then.\n\nAnd don’t put too much into this relationship in the meantime. He won’t. He’s been clear, which is better than what a lot of guys are.\n\nIf you don’t want to waste your time, break up with him now, for your own sake.\n\nBut if you’re okay with having someone to do stuff with, recreationally, sexually, or others wise, then stick with him until he goes abroad or you get tired of it.\n\nIt’s all up to you. Just don’t expect him to stick around long term. Don’t get your hopes up for marriage or any of that shit. Find someone else for that."}

You both need more sleep and more social support. Her daughter might be acting out because she senses all the tension in the household. \n\nHere are my suggestions:\n- look for a regular part-time job, maybe 3 days per week. Use that as your stable base and do food delivery when you have the energy. Take a step back from your business for now\n- have a proper sit-down conversation with her about building in more rest. You need an occasional lazy day and probably so does she.  What can you change in your weekly schedule that gives you both a bit more time to decompress and sleep?\n- find an online /whatsapp support group for the adhd. You need to talk to other people who understand it.\n- make sure you still tell her you love her and give her hugs and kisses every day, every when you're frustrated\n\nI also have inattentive adhd. It's hard to go through life feeling like every single thing you do is wrong and out of control, and everyone around you hates you for it. \nWhich medication are you on? I have Xaggitin (slow-release methylphenidate) and it has been a game changer, but it took at least 6 weeks for my body to fully get used to it."}

{"prompt":"were my (23f) expectations too high for my husband (24m) during my recovery from a car accident? A few weeks ago, i (23 f) got in a pretty bad car accident. I was lucky to walk away with a fractured collarbone and a few scrapes. My husband (24 m) took a week off of work to help me and to be honest, by the end I was very upset with how he cared for me. \n\nIt is important to note that me and my husband separated 5 months ago and have been actively working on our relationship during this time. We also have a 1 and a half year old that was going to daycare during the days.\n\n\nThe things that i needed help with included sitting up, going to the bathroom, getting food/water/medicine, and helping with the baby in the evenings and mornings.\n\nWhere i got upset was that he started to get frustrated with me over simple things like needing to go to the bathroom. On one occasion, he left me in the bathtub all alone and went to bed and \"accidentally\" fell asleep. That night, i had to try to put my own clothes on and was in extreme pain. He blamed me for taking a bath too late at night (it was about 8:30), and so the next day i decided to take my bath earlier (like 5:30) we put my daughter in the tub with me and while in the middle of the bath he declared that his mom was there to go grocery shopping with him. He said that he had to leave right away and didn't have time to help me. I asked how long he would be gone, and he told me not long and left. The grocery store is 5 minutes away, and they were only grabbing a few things, so i waited 30 minutes before having to get myself and my toddler out of the bath and dressed. When he got home 1 hour later i asked what the deal was and he said that him and his mom got to talking and thats why he got back so late.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back for me though was that one night, in the second week of my recovery my daughter had made a mess on the bed and the sheets had to be washed. The sheets got washed and were dry and in the room but not back on the bed. He was complaining that he needed some alone time. I was giving him space when our daughter woke up after putting her down for the night. To try and be nice i used my one good arm to lift her out of her crib and onto the bed. I layed down with her until she calmed down and went back to sleep. A while later he came into the room and said \"you've got to be kidding me! The sheets aren't on the bed!\"  Then he turned to me and said \"(my name) would you ever put your head down on your pillow without a pillowcase?!\" I felt really hurt since i was trying to do something nice only to get chewed out for something i had no control over nor the ability to do.\n\nHe took the first week off of work. I stayed there for one more week so he could drop me off at work since i didn't have a car. After that, I went back to my grandma's house so I could get the help i needed without the resentment. \n\nI am ready to call off our whole relationship over this but he swears up and down that i am just being ridiculous. Were my expectations wrong? Was i expecting too much from him? I really need a reality check because i can not tell if i really am being selfish or if he is gaslighting me.\n\nTLDR: my husband took a week off of work and helped me for one week after that while i was recovering from a broken collarbone. He complained about me a lot during that time and pit me in bad situations.

I know you want to stay out of it and move on, but at the moment, your ex is controlling the narrative and, unfortunately, it might hinder you later on. \n\nI'm so glad you're planning on seeking therapy and taking some positive steps. Please, further consider speaking to a lawyer to discuss your options and potential issues. If you can't afford one, there might be resources available in your area that are worth looking into. \n\nI really, really hope you find some support so you're not battling this alone, OP.   \nI wish you all the best."}

For context me and my bf have been dating for a good 8 months now and when the time I asked him out, we were talking like in the beginning of the month and I asked him out quickly afterwards. But anyways I don’t bring up the past but one thing he said alarmed me, he told me he slept with his flatmate that time around may when we got into this relationship within like the first week of June, should I ask?

{"prompt":"I (26f) think I‘m still in love with my ex (28m), even though I‘m in a relationship and I‘m losing my mind Hello everyone, I‘m kinda anxious right now so bare with me - this might be a bit confusing.\n\nBasically I‘ve been dating my current boyfriend (29m) for about 5 months. We have a super healthy, stable relationship. He‘s really patient with me, loyal, communicative, supportive - basically treats me like a princess - very funny, emotionally intelligent etc. etc. His family is also great and we have all have a close relationship. \n\nabout two years ago I was dating my ex boyfriend, let‘s call him John(28m). We started dating at the beginning of corona, met through tinder. When we met something in me just clicked and I fell in love fast and hard. I wanted to be with him forever. I thought John was perfect in every way and the first 3 months were amazing. Then it slowly started to become rocky. John got angry pretty quickly, threw things around his room, yelled, also kicked in a door right next to me. I was always hoping that it was just a phase, but it didn‘t get better. Afterwards he would always apologize and we‘d reconcile. I was constantly triggered around him. Sounds like the basic toxic relationship right?\n\nWell, my current boyfriend worked really hard on gaining my trust and helped me heal. And since John and I haven‘t seen each other for more than a year, I thought everything would be fine again. BUT NOPE. I saw him an hour ago (accidentally), we talked and I felt all those butterflies again. He was so beautiful to me, I don‘t even wanna go into detail how I felt about him but - what do i do now?\n\nI wish I could feel that way about my current bf :( it‘s so unfair to him and I really don‘t want to feel that way about John…\nWhy do I feel that way?

Even though you get together occasionally, what is the goal here? Sending pictures is not enough. Does one of you plan to move to the other’s city? If not, it seems like an exclusive LDR means it is a safe way to connect but not do the work that a real relationship requires. Why not find someone locally who you can see all the time, be physical with, even take those silly long walks with? With this guy, you can’t even FaceTime. That sounds very frustrating. A good relationship should be fulfilling, can’t keep your hands off each other, not texting and looking at pictures and only seeing each other every few months."}

We make as much time as possible for each out and talk all day even if its just text. We spend all night talking in voice calls over the weekends and when I think about I can't help but smile even though the distance is hard. When we are together I feel content, safe, and loved. He sees me and loves me for me and helps me grow and do better for myself. There's no one on this planet I'd rather be with. Long distance isn't our end goal. We are both very physical people and know this isn't something either of us want to do for years and years. But moving is a serious decision. We decided to date for a year and then if things were still going well I'd move to him since he has the better job and his own home. I will be moving this summer. He is the love of my life and I have no doubts about his love for me.

During my miscarriage his mom passed away and he was very distant from me. long story short i gave him space to grieve his mom but i still let him know i needed some type of support from him. he acted like his loss was much bigger than mine and that he couldn’t be there for me as well. i had a feeling that something was going on based off his behavior these past weeks and decided to go through his phone. of course we got into an argument where he yelled “fuck that baby” so i kicked him out. of course i’m upset we broke up and he was cheating on me during a time i really needed him, but for him to say that about my baby is shocking. now i feel like my baby only mattered to me and everything was fake","completion":"What’s the context around your relationship?"}

{"prompt":"33F, 31M, 10 Yr Relationship. Seperarion/Divorce, How? So I've been thinking about this for a very long time and I think I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that I want to, at the very least, separate from my husband. I don't feel apriciated or even really loved. I just got home from a 2 days hospital trip, and his greeting was to look at me and then go into the kitchen, saying he was exhausted. Not a kiss or even a hug, or even a \"welcome home\", nothing... \n\nToday we were talking about kids a bit, we have one child together already and we want more down the line, however the illness I was hospitalised for, may leave me infertil, so we talked a bit about other options and such. He says he wants to adopt one at our child's age  because the first time is stressful, I mention I like the first time and that when you adopt, it's typically infants or slightly older anyways and he literally told me \"then you can take care of it yourself\" and it just hit me like a ton of bricks. I was alone about taking care of our kid for the first 6 months, but I suspected that my husband might have had a bit of PPD, so I did what I could. But now it sounds like that's exactly what I can expect again, and I just don't wanna deal with it anymore. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI know about all the legal steps to take, but how do you even start that conversation?

{"prompt":"Is my boyfriend (M29) not sexually attracted to me (F22), or does he have ED and is too embarrassed about opening up about it? Or is this normal??? Help! I (f22) started talking to now boyfriend (m29) at the beginning of December 2022, everything was going well. We finally met up and hung out for the first time just before new years. Before he and I had sex I was a virgin (and I knew he was not) we had sex three times in 12 hours the night I had met him. This led me to believe that he was finding me attractive or so I thought. \n\nHe planned our first real date which was on New Year's which ended in us having sex again less than a week later. I have never been under the impression the sex was not good, he finished every single time up until this point. Weeks go by and he continues to plan thoughtful dates, some really expensive ones too. We begin to spend more and more time as this January (2023) goes by, but the sex becomes few and far between. What was once also twice a day or at least once every time we saw each other (2-4 times a week), became less than once a week and even fewer than that. All the while we still continue to go on dates and get to know each other. \n\nWhen I had mentioned to him that I felt like we were not having sex much and I wanted that, he quickly explained he was really stressed with work and that he could not get his mind off of it, which made him feel as if he forced it he would not finish nor enjoy sex and how that was not fair to me. I accepted this and felt closer to him, as he opened up. But now as the weeks continue to go by nothing has changed he is still stressed with work. We are not going on as extravagant of dates and they are more casual, but he is still initiating all of them and planning them. He continues to tell me he loves spending time with me and is falling in love with me. He is still actively inviting me over to come to sleep and/ or spend time at his place. We have a TV show we like watching together and we talk and laugh so much!! \n\nPart of me wants to believe that he truly is just overwhelmed and stressed with work and I know he is, but I am new to the \"sex world\" I would like to think sex would take someone's mind off of a stressful work day. When I ask friends (guys and girls) they immediately assume and say that he must be gay. I never wanted to believe this because when we are intimate he always wants the lights on and to be able to look at my face and see me and look into my eyes. I have come to find out per the internet and through hearing about my friends (f 22-26) it sounds like we have very intimate sex (i have never had sex before this, so all I know. )\n\nI have taken into account that because I have only just discovered sex this means I have a strong desire to continue to have sex, but I am unsure why he can't get into the mood more than once a week. We don't really even make out or do anything besides the occasional peck. We cuddle all the time and find a lot of comfort in each other's embrace. \n\nI will add here that last night we were playing a game to get to know each other better (a literal card game), and I got a card that made me ask him to \"admit something\" which he then said and I quote \"I took some dick pills before we started this so I could try and fuck you tonight\" (he was slightly drunk and usually does not talk like that.) He has had trouble in the past staying hard or getting hard which just made me think he was not that into me. It didn't cross my mind that at 29 he could have ED issues. \n\nHe mentioned to me recently that I have been making him feel guilty for not being in the mood to have sex and that it makes me not want to have sex even more because he feels guilty. I apologized because my intentions are never to make him feel guilty or ashamed. I only ever want him to feel loved, wanted, and accepted. I realized at that moment that maybe I had been pushing it too hard or mentioning it in a not kind way. I apologized and made sure he knew that I never wanted him to feel guilty as much as I just wanted him to know where I stood about it all. I told him, that his not being in the mood or not having sex more often made me feel bad and like he was not attracted to me even though he has told me multiple times this is not the case. He then said that my feeling that way was on me because we had talked about it numerous times at this point and he had assured me it was not my fault. \n\nMy heart says it does not just work, but I have considered that he was cheating and I am around way too much, and he just moved to the area in late December around the time I had just met him. I also don't believe he would continue to actively pursue me if he was having sex with someone else and it was better than why keep me around? I really like him and we do refer to each other as our Girlfriend/boyfriend, I am even about to meet his family very soon. \n\nAm I being over the top and reading way too into this? How could someone continue to pursue me and not be able to keep it up, the once a week we try and have sex? Is he not attracted to me? Or does he have ED problems that he does not want to outright come out and say to me? Why would he continue to get to know me and show all the signs of what a healthy relationship is but not want to have sex?

{"prompt":"Should I (M22) apologize first to my friend (M22) for matching with his crush on tinder? Me (22M) and \"Mike\" (22M) have been friends since elementary school. We befriended very quickly at about age 6-7, and until we were about 14 he was absolutely my best friend. then I moved and changed schools, and we lost touch, but regained it at about 18. \n\nNeither of us has been in a relationship, we're both autistic so it's had to start anything w girls (and in my case also with men since I'm bi - this will be important later) and about a year ago we decided to make a fake tinder account, just to see what it's like and how it works. \n\nBit of backgroun: Mike had the biggest crush on one of our classmates, \"Kay\" (F, same age as us). They had all their classes together, but he never even attempted to talk to her. I had some classes with Kay, and I remember she was very funny if a bit mean. Mike crushed on her hard since he was 9 and he still had a crush on her when I moved and changes schools. \n\nWhen we were looking at tinder we found Kay's profile, and I said something like that's the girl you had a crush on! and he basically acted very embarrassed and told me to just close tinder and we should leave it behind and stop, so I did and we didn't speak on that again. \n\nAbout a month ago I decided to re-make tinder, and surprise, I found Kay again. Thinking she definitely remembered me as her middle school classmate (since I remembered her) I swiped right on her, and she swiped right on me too, but didn't remembered me, so i reminded her we went to school together, and i wanted to catch up. She was willing, we talked a lot about what has changed since then, why I moved, etc and it turned out my work is near her uni, and we decided to meet and talk some more, and it went really well and I really like her as a friend, unsure about the romantic aspect yet, since she hasn't said anything even remotely romantic to me and I'm new to this so I'm waiting for her to make the first move. \n\nSince then I went over to Mike, and told him I met Kay, and his face just dropped. He wanted to know everything, why we met, when, where, and I told him I met her on tinder since I think it was completely normal to swipe right on someone i know/knew irl. He got extremely pissed, started shouting, told me he never stopped having crush on her and he was sure I knew and I told him that I had no idea that, but since that bothers him I won't see her again, and then he said \"Of course she wasn't interested in me, I didn't know she's into fags\" and that pissed me off a lot. I told him who the fuck he thinks he is, thinking it's okay to call me that, and if he apparently had a crush on her for nearly 15 fucking years it's just pathetic he never bothered to talk to her, and I just left, unwilling to listen to anything else he wanted to say to me. \n\nThat was a week ago, and since then we haven't talked to each other. I admit I don't think I did the right thing but also I really like Kay as a friend so far, but I would hate to lose Mike's friendship. Should I apologize first? I really don't want to talk to him since he called me a slur, but I did fucked up first when i decided to meet with Kay without telling him, and maybe I should be the one to extend the olive branch. Also. Should I stop talking to Kay?\n\nTLDR: my friend called me a slur after I met with a girl he had a crush on since elementary school. should I apologize to him or just end the friendship? I'm so lost.","completion":"You have no need to apologize, and if he doesn’t apologize to you, he’s not the friend you think he is. And no, I don’t believe you have any obligation to stop talking to Kay."}
{"prompt":"Did I 20 M screw up my chances with this girl 19 F ? Be real with me. I’m a 20 year old guy and I’m in a class with this really cool/cute girl. She just has a cool mysterious vibe that I’m into. Anyway, we got paired up for a partner thing in class one day and it felt like we had really good chemistry. We were laughing with each other and the teacher was basically telling us to be quiet multiple times 🤷‍♂️. Anyway I didn’t have my phone on me and didn’t ask for her number (stupidly). She’s always the first one out of class cause she’s by the door and I can never seem to catch up with her to ask her to hang out or for her number. So I went home and requested to follow her Instagram (we gave each other our names in class so I already knew it). She didn’t accept or reject it for a day, so I just unrequested so I didn’t come off as weird. Did I screw up here? Was it too soon? I just got out of a long relationship and haven’t had to think about these things for a while. If I did screw up I’d love some honest advice about how I could fix the situation. I’m not obsessing over being with this girl, I’d rather just get to know her first, but I’m worried I came off too strong.","completion":"yeah you're right. I just kept replying everything in my head on loop and I just couldn't think clearly anymore about the whole situation. Mike really really let me down. \nand thanks, i appreciate that"}
{"prompt":"28f. 42m. unsure if 1 yr relationship is good for me mentally. I'm 28 and my boyfriend is 42. We are coming up on our 1 year next week. We moved quickly. We moved in together after a couple months of dating. We were coworkers / friends a year prior to getting together. He made a move on me my last day of the job we had together. We no longer work together.\n\nMonths ago (maybe September or October) I found out he was following hundreds of half naked women on Instagram and tiktok. All of a sudden I just had a feeling. I don't know why or how. I just all of a sudden knew. I looked to give myself the peace of mind that I was wrong but he was following hundreds of those types of accounts. During this time i was also on his phone for whatever reason (with him present and he handed it to me) and an Instagram notification came up. It was his friend sending him another profile. I thought it over for a couple days before bringing it up to him. I'm fine with the occasional porn or what not but this was excessive. \n\nWe worked through it over a couple days. He offered to unfollow the accounts. I didn't ask him for it. He offered and he did unfollow a lot of accounts. I thought he handled it really well at the time. At the time he also told me he didn't think anything of it because it wasn't an issue in other  relationships. His friend that sends him the profiles is also married and it isn't an issue in his relationship. He also told me he rarely goes on Instagram so he didn't realize how excessive it was. He did agree that it was excessive. The two things about how he handled it I didn't like was the comment about his friend and him saying he doesn't care what I do on my accounts and isn't watching them. \n\nFast forward to now. He is on instagram ALL the time. Never in front of me but I can see that he is active. I asked him about it a while back and he said that his habits can change. I don't know if this is true or he was trying to tell me what I thought I needed to hear before. He is still following a decent number of those types of accounts. I also found out he turned off his Instagram notifications. When I asked him why he did that he said because it caused an issue. I took that as instead of fixing the issue now he is hiding. \n\n Lately I have been obsessed with seeing if he is online or when he was online last. I have been doing it for the last couple months. I didn't do it at first but recently. He is online a lot. I still get upset about what happened and believe it is still ongoing. Again I'm fine with the occasional porn or whatever but not with how excessive it is. I find it hurtful and disrespectful especially after we already discussed it.\n\nI also feel like he isn't actually attracted to me. None of these girls look like me. I gained weight from going on an IUD and I don't work out as much as I used to. He has shattered my self confidence. \n\nIn the beginning of our relationship he didn't initiate. He did start to after I talked to him about it. I have told him I feel like he isn't attracted to me and he assures me that he is. I have told him a need more from him sexually. It lasts for about a week then goes back to normal. He also seems to care more about pleasuring himself than anything else. I had to tell him to touch me. He sometimes has issues with getting it up. He blames his medicine. He has high blood pressure and diabetes. I understand his older as well so his needs are different. His eyes are also closed the entire time we do anything. I asked him about it and he said he just wants to feel how good it is. He doesn't want to at least look at me sometimes but he can look at all those other girls. \n\nOn the other hand he makes me happy. We are good together. We never raised our voices at each other. We had issues but we discussed them. He helped me through my cat passing away. He is supportive and he encourages me. I can be myself with him. He wakes up early to make me breakfast before work and has dinner when I'm home. He also works just not as long as I day as me. \n\nI feel like I need to talk to him about this but I don't know how. I feel like it isn't fair to me to continue this way. I don't want to cause issue or make him feel like I don't trust him. I have been feeling this way for a long time. \n\nWe just signed a new lease and have a big trip planned for our anniversary. I don't think it's fair to either of us to continue like this.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.","completion":"yeah. im autistic too (that's mainly why we befriended in the first place lmao) and you're right, friendship is valuable. i don't think I'll ever make a friend as close as him again, and we sure did say fucked up things to each other before but he never stooped so low, which is why i was so taken aback by what he said. i just can't stop thinking if that's what he was thinking about me all this time and he just finally let it out. i need to talk to him straight and talk it all out. pride really is a killer. thanks man"}

{"prompt":"My (19F) family, doesn’t like my boyfriend (19M) even though they’ve never met him. M\n\nFor context, I (19 F) have been dating a guy (19 M) for about 6 months now. I haven’t told my family yet because I don’t know how they’d react, but I was planning to tell them on Valentine’s Day. \n\nInto the real story here. \n\nMy family doesn’t know I’m dating him, and yet somehow they’ve formed an opinion on him solely based on his outward appearance and the few conversations they’ve had together, in which he’s always been very nice and polite. \n\nHe’s on the heavier side, and I know my family isn’t a fan of that. I personally don’t care. He’s never been a bad sport about his weight, always cracking jokes about it and doesn’t let it hold him back, and he’s actively trying to lose weight, so I can look past that. \n\nI really do like him, and I just wished my family wasn’t so quick to judge someone they’ve never actually met. Every time they’ve interacted it’s because he’s been helping me, usually to carry heavy things to and from my moms car. He’s incredibly helpful. \n\nI’m certain the only reason they don’t like him, is one, because he’s on the darker side (we’re not white but somehow my family is still very racist) and two, because he’s a heavier guy (which I feel isn’t fair because no one in my family is exactly small or skinny themselves). \n\nI don’t really know what to do because I know if I introduce him to my family they’re going to tell me not to be with him or that they don’t like him, and there’s really not much I can do to change their mind. But if I don’t introduce him to them, it’ll just end badly because they’ll likely find out eventually considering his family already knows we’re dating. (Side note, they don’t really like me either. It’s another racism related thing along with some other personal stuff) \n\nWhat should I do?","completion":"You're insecure and jealous.

He started going to job interviews in sweatpants and never changed job types. I had to push him to get going and this built resentment that he was taking advantage of my kindness. \n\nI planned a European vacation for us, paid for it, and asked him to just plan one day for us. At the airport, on our way to our destination, he revealed to me that he was in massive debt and didn’t know what to do. He was mopey and angry our whole vacation. Didn’t want to go to dinner on my birthday or do anything touristy because it cost money. I tried to make the best of it because I was looking forward to it and put so much energy planning this vacation. He never planned the day I asked for and got mad at me that I was mad about it. \n\nOver the years, I explained I felt I had too much on my shoulders. He was always job hopping, using all his time off when he didn’t need it, and not having it when he really needed it, and having to either get fired or quit.  This never changed. He would go a couple months or longer between jobs to the point I would have to nag him and ask what was going on. He would get angry and say as long as he pays his half, why do I care??  I didn’t feel secure. I would never do that to him because I feel it puts more pressure on your partner.\n\nFast forward to the thing that was the last straw for me. My mom almost died and needed emergency surgery. I left town last minute. At the same time, our water heater broke and we had no hot water. We live in an apartment so he just had to call and be there when they fix it. He said no he had too much on his plate. He left it for me. We had a conversation when I got back about how much that hurt me and he needs to help me more. The hot water issue continued over two months and his effort to help didn’t improve. He told me it wasnt a big deal to not have hot water but he knew it was important to me.\n\nThere’s more but that’s the core of it.\n\nWriting this out is helping me realize I don’t deserve this and I want someone more on my level. I plan on being alone for a long time. I know it’s normal to question your decision but sometimes I think we can keep growing together. I’m just not sure he’s interested in being responsible for himself. Instead of being an adult and finding a place to live , he’s going to quit his job and live with a friend. At times I feel I was used for the security I provided.  My heart gradually shut off to him. \n\nPlease someone tell me what you think. Obviously this is all the bad stuff but the good stuff feels so overshadowed.","completion":"&gt;writing this out is helping me realize I don’t deserve this. \n\nDing ding ding."}

{"prompt":"My (28M) Sister-In-Law (32F) lied to my family and made me pay €60K I (M 28) have a sister in law, Rose (F 32) whom was married to my brother, Matt (M 30) around last June. This is pretty hard to explain but bear with me. I am pretty at lost here because she is putting a strife on my already non existant relationship with my mother.\n\nMy father has a jet. Nothing fancy but he travels for work a lot and would often stay on site for weeks. When he is not using the jet, all of us can use it as long as we pay for the fuel, landing fees, hangar and bla bla bla expenses you get the idea.\n\nLast December, I visited a few old friends in London. We have planned to spend the month at a ski resort until Christmas. I booked the jet first. Of course my SIL, Rose, at the very last minute asked me if she and a few friends could tag along since they wanted to do a quick shopping in London. \n\nI told her I would be in London for only 2 days and then the jet will drop me in Switzerland before heading back. The jet wont be used until this year January and the hangar fees in Switzerland is just different, so it makes sense for me to use my family hangar back home. She was cool with my travel plans so we traveled there together.\n\nI don't normally use the family jet to fly on my own. That trip was only the 4th time I ever used it personally. I would normally just fly like a normal person because I don't make much. While all of us siblings do receive monthly allowance, I prefer to spend it on better endeavors.\n\nAnyway, about a week ago, my father called me. He rarely calls me so when he does, every single bones in my body will tremble with anxiety. Apparently he told me I haven't paid for my travel expenses. My family pilot holds a card. All of the flying expenses will be billed on that card. Its a personal card charged to my father.\n\nEverytime when we use the jet, it is expected of us to settle the expenses right away but if its a large sum, before the month ends. I told him I already did. He then told me to check with a family accountant or he will cut it from my allowance for the few upcoming months. \n\nLong story short, apparently, the jet did not travel back home like it was supposed to. My SIL had called the pilot to fly back to London when the jet stopped in Rome for fuel. She and her friends then, began a tour around europe, even a stop in marrakesh and all the way to fucking Maldives in the middle of fucking winter. \n\nShe then stupidly lied to my family. We later found out about the lie from our pilot. When confronted, she insisted on the lie and is now playing the victim. She is barely three months pregnant but is walking like she is due yesterday. My siblings are all boys. Naturally, as the only girl in the family, my mother felt compelled to side with her.\n\nI felt betrayed. Here is why. Around 10 years ago my mother had two very bad accidents, back to back. First, it was a traffic accident that pretty much left her hips permanantly damaged. Second, was a robbery. We had 3 maids and a nurse living at the house at that time. Save for my mom who was resting in the living space, which was hidden from the main corridor, all of them were found tied and gagged in the common hall. Luckily, nothing happened.\n\nShe now gets panic attacks if the driver drives a little too fast or when she sees a stranger in the house, you get the idea. I was in boarding school when it happened, so when I graduated, instead of furthering my studies abroad, I opted to read in a local university to keep an eye on her. Mind you, I am the brightest academically in the family.\n\nI did not regret making that decision. I have always been bookish, a little techy and my siblings have always made fun of my hobbies. I prefer everything tech and art. I post many artworks on my tumblr btw. i never really care because I didn't spend much time with any of them anyway. My two youngest was only 8 and 3 when I left for boarding school at 13. I had a closer relationship with my older brother before he left for boarding but he later decided I wasn't cool enough to hang with. Whatever.\n\nWhen I finished boarding school I helped care for my mother. I never get to experience living the social calender year after school. All throughout university I will drive home every weekend, holidays and free time to keep her company. She can walk and everything, but since the accident and the robbery she prefers to stay alone as we found out that one of the guy working security was in on it.\n\nWhen covid hits, I was the only who stayed home. I made her meal three times a day (buy when I cant), clean her room, wash the laundry the whole stuff even today. I picked a less lucrative career path with flexibility so I can accomodate her needs better. It was only around two years ago when we confessed feeling comfortable with each other around. I might not make as much money but I feel a lot more fulfilled, getting to spend a lot of time with my mother.\n\nI don't understand how she is siding with her and insisted that I just pay so we can get it over with. My father doesn't really do family dramas, my older brother whole heartedly believes his wife, my 2 youngest are degenerates and couldn't care less and now my mother is acting like if my SIL has a miscarriage, it will be on me. \n\nMy older brother and his wife moved into the family house when they found out about the pregnancy a little over a month ago. They are acting as if I am not doing anything around the house. I work from home so unless I am doing chores or I am free, I am locked in front of my laptop. \n\nAt lunch today my brother said something that really hurts my feeling. My mother didn't say anything and my SIL was just lounging with with fake tears. For the past 4 years I have lived here full time, keeping my mother company and try maintaining this house on my own. Save for the garden, I do everything else by myself.\n\nI hate confronting people. I also understand my mother never asked me to sacrifice anything for her. I feel like packing my bag tonight and just leave for Sweden or something. I heard its quiet up north. I just recently broke up too. I am sorry if this sounds like ranting. \n\nAre there any viable solutions that I am not seeing that doesn't require me making peace with my SIL? I treasure my relationship with my mother, but I don't know for sure if she feels the same. Sometimes I wish my brother never married my SIL. I hate it how she can charm my mother in a few weeks and it took me years to do the same. \n\nTldr - SIL lied and made me pay her travel expenses and my mother sided with her.","completion":"I offered to doorsdash it and he said it was no problem to pick it up.

{"prompt":"Do i(18F) still care for him(18M)? Hello, I am just gonna jump right in. (Im 18F I know that’s young I don’t want advice sayin I am too younger or don’t know what love is) I tend to break up with all the men I date I completely don’t understand how I feel and then i break up with them. And that brings us to this guy I started seeing let’s call him Kyle(18m). This relationship was only for 3ish months but clearly has impacted me. He is the only boyfriend I’ve had that didn’t make me feel like the other woman in one way or another. And he is perfect on paper and he was perfect in person too, however I had to make the first move in everything, ask him out first kiss him first just things like that. I think that was almost trauma from his past relationship but other than that he was perfect. I ended up breaking up with him though because I got scared anxious and stopped knowing any of my emotions, I ended up latching on to and developed feelings for someone else in hind sight as an excuse to break up with him I’m pretty sure. But I broke up with him anyways. It’s been a few months and I still think about him every once and awhile and I look up his Instagram every now and then which he deleted soon after we broke up. But recently I’ve started to feel like breaking up with him was a mistake and I still care for him very deeply. And I don’t know if this is just me wanting a relationship ship, or wanting Kyle. I looked him up on Instagram again today and he got Instagram again, right when I saw the account pop up I started sobbing. And I feel I do still care for him and want a relationship but right when I think about it I don’t know how I feel at all. Am I trying to talk myself into a relationship or out of one?

I can't speak to his motivations for ghosting you, but saying \"you had a chance\" and that you \"ruined it\" seems like the coward's way of ending the relationship (as all ghosting is) without admitting his faults or other interests.\n\nEither way, continuing to pursue him is toxic and you are better than NEEDING someone.

I (M25) have been with my girlfriend (F25) for around 4 months. We met on a dating app, and after 2 months we decided to be official. As in, I asked her to be my girlfriend, she agreed. I don’t have much experience relationship wise, which fuels my belief that I could be acting clingy, but I do think it’s more than that.\n\nThroughout the relationship, in my opinion, every moment we’ve spent together in person has been great. We’ve talked about personal things like family, been intimate regularly, and at times it seems she doesn’t want the evening to end. So all good right… \n\n(Before I explain the next part, I should say to her credit she’s got a busy schedule, with work and other similar clubs and activities. All which are genuine reasons to be tied up during the day and weekends, and I wouldn’t expect her to ever stop doing something or change because of me. Nor do I expect us to be constantly in contact 24/7 or even every day. \n\nHowever, these are my concerns when apart: \n\n- Its always difficult to see her, and when we do hang out, it’s always limited time wise. We never spend an entire day together, and never the night. We only see each other roughly once every week/ week and a bit. This affects me, but alone isn’t the problem, I recognise her commitments. \n\n\n- The main issue lies in the seeming lack of effort. Every message takes hours for a response, so it’s difficult to discuss anything - (yes we could call but see next paragraph). Attempts to make plans when busy on her part, are rarely met with attempts to rearrange on particular days. 90% of plans derive from me.\n\n\n- I try calling occasionally just to talk or plan something,  but she almost never picks up - again could just be busy which I accept. However, missed calls only receive an apology text hours later. I never receive a call back. In fact, I don’t think she’s ever randomly called in four months just to talk to me- which I’ll admit is a bit upsetting. When she was away for a week with work, I thought I’d give her one call in the evening near the end of the trip to see how things were goings- I got 10mins of her time.\n\n- an example which actually affected me: Recently I had to travel back home for a sad event which she knew.

A partially valid excuse, but in my head, if my partner ever texted asking to call after seeming upset or having been through something, I would not hesitate to give them my time, even just for half an hour. Would you not always do that for someone important?\n\n- for all points above, they feel even worse when combined with how she organises her time with others.

Before this relationship few years back i was in a relationship with another girl for almost 2 years . What i have noticed is i get too desperate too fast.i have noticed that everytime my current  girl over even in the past with my ex tried to break up with me i just can't take it even if i know it's not really a break up i also get these feelings like what to do now ? , What will happen to me ? ,I can't without her , i need to call her . Then i cry and beg her not to leave me . If she blocks me i go outside her house then we make it up. I dont know why i am like this and what i should do to  stopbeing so desperate and weak when i fall in love . The girl that i am dating currently is a very nice girl  but i feel now that she is taking me for granted and it's my own fault for being like this .she wasn't like this before i started being needy and emotional and desperate . The situation right now is i don't think she even respects me that's why in anger she wrote not to come begging outside her house . I know she also loves me a lot but i feel my own desperate attitude is eventually making her lose respect for me because she wasn't like this until i slowly became desperate. In the previous relationship also my ex left me because i was like this . Please suggest on what should I do .","completion":"You are stating in your TDLR that the fiancée lied to him. How do you know? You are talking about someone you knew a very long time ago. On top of that you also admit you were doing shit too. Are you saying neither of you can change or changed already growing up into adults?\n\nAnd how do you know what she told him or not? Maybe she did. I got 4 sisters and we are all close. But that does not mean I can exactly predict what they would or would not approve of. In many situations they did/accepted something I NEVER Expected them to do or accept. You cannot read minds. \n\nRegardless, if she seems like a good partner to your brother now and they're happy, stay out of it. You got 0 facts so you'd probably end up causing more trouble than \"fixing\" anything. You are literally just guessing and want to smear his fiancée's name over it without being sure if she told him or not. Stand down."}

However, being dishonest to those you claim to love is wrong.  \n\n\nI do feel bad about the shit I was into when I was younger, so I don't want to publicly air it all out. But I did offer to tell my (now) wife about my past. I told her some generalities of what I was doing, but she said she didn't want specifics (especially sexual history), so as per her request I didn't say anything more. She was given the option to know everything, but declined. I've never lied or hidden anything from her. Whereas I know for a fact that my brother's fiancée is lying because he's not the type to accept women with a past like hers."}

I was about to ask her if she wanted to go get some this morning, but I come to find out that she's already out and about getting lunch with someone else.

{"prompt":"My (24F) Boyfriend (26M) Has Been Acting Strangely With His Ex My boyfriend, let’s call him B, has been acting very strange with his ex. We have been dating for around 7 months, and I’m just realizing that maybe I should’ve noticed more in the beginning. Right off the bat, after we had only been exclusive for a couple of weeks, he went to meet up with a friend, and was acting nervous about saying who it was. I asked him if there was any chance that this “friend” was an ex, and he brushed it off by saying they had a “fling a couple years back” but that it was never serious and that they decided they were better off as friends. He said he would’ve told me but didn’t want me to worry. \n\n I later found out that it seems a lot more serious than just a “fling”, but I let it go as I trusted my boyfriend and thought maybe he just didn’t want to worry me. Cut to a few weeks down the line, and my boyfriend goes on trip over the weekend with a group from work, and she works in the same company so she was there too. Over the weekend, he barely texted me, told me that the signal there was just super bad, and that he would talk when he can. Then some photos arise on social media of a large group of people from their work, but they are together in all of them, leading me to think he spent most, if not all, of his weekend with her. In the photos she was hugging in to him with her leg over him and they looked very cozy together, which made me slightly uncomfortable. \n\nBut this was all months ago and if I’m truthful, I forgot about it a little and let it go. But due to work, we haven’t been able to hang out as much recently, and so we call on a night, and when we call his phone goes crazy all through the night every time we call. When I ask “what are you up to?” He says “just laying here, not really looking at my phone” even though I can hear him texting and hear a hundred texts coming through. I thought nothing of it at first, but then last night we hung out, and she was texting him none stop, so I’m assuming it’s her texting him all hours of the night. When she would text, he was quickly sliding the notifications away and hiding what she was saying, like he didn’t want me to see what was going on. Any social media he went on with messaging, she was at the top: texts, Instagram DM’s, Snapchat. And I managed to actually see one of the texts and she said she’s going to get a tattoo to match his. I personally find getting a matching tattoo with your ex, especially when your ex is in a relationship, is very strange and I find it slightly disrespectful to me that she would do that. \n\n I asked one of our mutual friends what he thinks, and he said they’re just really good friends and that if I’m worried then I should just talk to my boyfriend, and that my boyfriend is “crazy about [me]” and wouldn’t do that. I want to talk to my boyfriend, but I feel like my boyfriend will say I’m overreacting and that I shouldn’t scrutinise his friendships. In the past when I’ve questioned his behaviour, he says I paint him as a terrible person and create a narrative that he’s some kind of villain, and that he doesn’t like the way I think of him. He has also said that I mustn’t love him for who he is if I think he would do these things, and that I don’t respect him by asking him these questions, which makes me feel like I can’t raise the issue without it blowing up in my face and him wanting to end the relationship. I guess I just want to know if I am overthinking it, or if I should be worried about the way he’s acting with this ex? \n\nTL;DR Boyfriend hid that his “friend” was an ex, lies about texting her, hides messages from her, spent a weekend at a work event with her and took flirty photos together, and now she’s getting a tattoo to match his. Friends say they’re just really good friends. Should I be worried?","completion":"Yea. You should be worried. He’s hiding communication from you so he knows it’s wrong. Then he’s telling you that you are basically in the wrong for having doubts. I wouldn’t be ok with any of that. I would cut my losses and walk if you can. Otherwise, you’ll need to have a real conversation with him where you are adamant that he can’t dismiss you. If he still dismisses your feelings then i think that’s an answer for you, that you aren’t likely to make it. Serious long term relationships don’t look like this."}

{"prompt":"M40 and F36 - Whenever we argue, she needs closeness to resolve the tension, and I need distance. Can this be reconciled? **TL;DR - recurring and seemingly irreconcilable conflict in an otherwise good relationship with plenty of good times.** Sorry if this post is too long.\n\nI am a 40 year old man, my partner is a 36 year old woman. I am currently unemployed, usually work in low level admin, and she is in management (we've never worked together). Neither of us have an issue with our earnings disparity. We've been together two years, live 100 miles apart, spend our weekends together at either place.\n\nWe were at her place today and she told me she would be going out for an hour, but didn't tell me why and I didn't ask. She had some time before her friend arrived to pick her up. She took off her makeup and we played video games together.\n\nHer friend texted her on arrival and my gf got up to leave. I told her I'd play online while she was out, and plugged in my headphones. I was in the online lobby when I heard her call out from the other room: \"I'll take that as a no.\" I took the headphones out and asked her what she had said. She said it didn't matter. I could tell she was annoyed, so I asked again. She said she had asked if I wanted a drink or snack before she left. I said I was sorry I can't hear much with headphones in. I said no thank you to the offer and she left.\n\nWhen she came back, she had her makeup bag with her and I saw that she was made up again. I expressed surprise that she took off her makeup only to put it back on again. She said that her friend had done it as a practice run, because we are going to a party in a few weeks and her friend is going to do her makeup then.\n\nWe went in to the kitchen to make dinner, and I sat at the table to type something on my laptop - not an essay, just a quick thought I had about a project I'm working on. She said something to me while I was typing a sentence, and as I finished it I looked up to ask what she said. She said it didn't matter and she wasn't going to compete with a computer for my attention. I stood up and asked her to please tell me because I cannot do two things at once. If my mind is on a task, I cannot process other things, even if I recognise that something has been said.\n\nShe was upset that she got made up specially for me and I didn't even notice. I told her that I noticed she had makeup on again and she looked good. I just didn't see any difference to how she looked earlier in the day before she took her makeup off, and I didn't understand why she had done that.\n\nI could tell that she was hurt by this and I felt shitty about it. When this sort of conflict occurs I feel like I am in a minefield and I'd rather keep silent than put a foot wrong and make things worse - sort of like that old saying, \"better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt\". I strive to be always honest, but I know it can upset people when I am.\n\nUnfortunately this escalated things because she kept asking me to communicate with her and I didn't know what to say. She said she wanted my attention, and I felt like I was giving it to her wholeheartedly, but because I was silent she just said \"Nothing?\" and turned and left the room. This seems to happen every time we argue.\n\nEventually we agreed to make dinner and watch TV to try and move on, but as we were making dinner she kept asking me questions, like \"Do you think we should do the veg at the same time as the chicken, or afterwards?\", \"Do you think the chicken is done yet?\", \"Should we use the rest of the seasoning, or is that enough?\"\n\nI can feed myself well enough, but I know next to nothing about cooking and she is practically an expert in comparison, so I always defer to her in the kitchen. For each question, I said \"I have no idea.\" This infuriated her more, but she seemed to calm down when I told her that she is better qualified to make those calls.\n\n(Sometimes she asks me questions then disregards what I say. While we were shopping earlier, she asked me what seasoning we should get, and I picked the spicy one. She said it was too spicy for her, so we got the mild one instead. I asked, \"why didn't you just pick the one you wanted instead of asking me and then shooting me down?\" This upset her.)\n\nWe were eating and watching our show. I was still uncomfortable, and I could tell she was too. We finished eating and she apologised \"for being hard work\", and I said I was sorry for contributing to it. She said when she is feeling anxious, she needs physical affection to reassure her. The trouble is, I want the opposite in these situations; I don't feel sexy or affectionate at all, just awkward with a need to be alone. She asked if I would give her a hug so I opened my arm for her to lean in, which she did while we watched the end of the show.\n\nAfter the show, she said she was going to bed. I decided to stay up for a while. She wasn't happy about this, and said again that she needs some affection to feel better after our argument. I told her that I need some space to recover.\n\nThe conversation escalated again, and it felt like she was demanding I ignore my own needs in favour of hers. I hate going over the same ground repeatedly in these conversations, and asked her to please just drop it because I couldn't see a resolution. She said she just wanted things to be normal again, and I asked why then did she persist in recapitulating the argument which wasn't getting us anywhere? This did not help. I was frustrated that I could not get through to her that I needed some space, so I decided to pack my things and go home. It took a minute to gather my stuff, with her screaming at me not to abandon her as I left.\n\nThat sounds pretty awful, but we have a good relationship for the most part. We have similar interests, and we're both kinky in very compatible ways. We're both happy living separately and remaining unmarried. She always tells me she's happy that I'm not insecure or jealous like previous partners. She talks me up to her friends and colleagues (tbh it's jarring to me because I'm far from perfect).\n\nThese situations crop up frequently, where her anxieties make her clingy and want to talk, and mine make me crave distance and solitude. I don't know how to resolve that without one of us ignoring our own needs in favour of the other.\n\nWhen we're both feeling good, we communicate very well, and can be frank about our own weaknesses and what we appreciate about each other, but that doesn't seem to help when conflict arises.

She had some time before her friend arrived to pick her up. She took off her makeup and we played video games together.\n\nHer friend texted her on arrival and my gf got up to leave. I told her I'd play online while she was out, and plugged in my headphones. I was in the online lobby when I heard her call out from the other room: \"I'll take that as a no.\" I took the headphones out and asked her what she had said. She said it didn't matter. I could tell she was annoyed, so I asked again. She said she had asked if I wanted a drink or snack before she left. I said I was sorry I can't hear much with headphones in. I said no thank you to the offer and she left.\n\nWhen she came back, she had her makeup bag with her and I saw that she was made up again. I expressed surprise that she took off her makeup only to put it back on again. She said that her friend had done it as a practice run, because we are going to a party in a few weeks and her friend is going to do her makeup then.\n\nWe went in to the kitchen to make dinner, and I sat at the table to type something on my laptop - not an essay, just a quick thought I had about a project I'm working on. She said something to me while I was typing a sentence, and as I finished it I looked up to ask what she said. She said it didn't matter and she wasn't going to compete with a computer for my attention. I stood up and asked her to please tell me because I cannot do two things at once. If my mind is on a task, I cannot process other things, even if I recognise that something has been said.\n\nShe was upset that she got made up specially for me and I didn't even notice.

She said she wanted my attention, and I felt like I was giving it to her wholeheartedly, but because I was silent she just said \"Nothing?\" and turned and left the room.

The way I grieve seem to be very similar to your husband, I rarely cry and not really something I like to do infront of others. I keep myself busy, so I don't have to constantly think about the thing that's causing the grief and I am then able to process it in a slower bit for bit way that's healthy for me. It's hard for me to just sit still and feel miserable and I would rather use those emotions productively.\n\nNow that doesn't really mean I don't cater to the emotional needs of those around me grieving and I think your husband is doing that. He is trying to stay strong for you and himself, to show that as awful and heartbreaking the loss is, there is hope in the future and that he feels he needs to hold it together, because he feels someone needs to. I do understand that's not what you want to hear from him in the moment, but I think that adds some perspective to his actions \n\nI certainly understand where all your feelings and concerns are coming from, but I think you need to understand you can't tell him how to grieve, you can tell him how he can supportive of you in this time and how you likely wise can also be supportive of him.

I have repeatedly asked for a scaled down wedding, say just a meal with two families such that my parents wont be embarrassed while her 30 relatives are celebrating.  But she insisted a wedding with deluxe hotel room and 3 female friends and 1 male friend as “bridesmaids”.  And with all types of prop, makeup, photographers, three sets of wedding gowns, 50+ relatives and friends in a morning.  My arguments were disregarded.\n\nTwo months in marriage she is back to her schedule of meeting various friends.  This week she did not come home after work twice going to racecourse with friends &amp; staycation with female friends.  She is also going to Turkey with another female friend in March and to Xinjiang in May (in her defence I cant take leave then).  It does seem strange a newly wed would not accompany her husband as much as possible in less than 2 months of marriage.  I have to make clear that at this point things are getting progressive and I already made my feelings known on a frequent basis.\n\nFast forward to my wife’s staycation night with friends.  I was alone at home and when my mother heard about this she was livid and said my wife has no sincerity at all in her part of the marriage.  She sent an angry message to my wife at 12:30am asking why she was at staycation as a newly wed as her time at home is already limited due to roster duty.  My wife saw the message and asked me what happened.  I told her we are waiting for her at home to discuss the matter as a family.  It is now 11:00am and my wife is still on staycation and never replied.\n\nTLDR:  Wife (30F) seems to care about herself and friends above me, and is not a decent person after all.","completion":"She is batshit insane and you need to get the hell away from this woman yesterday."}

There's no resolving the first issue, of you both being upset/disagreeing about what was safe, without resolving the second issue of you calling him stupid first. \n\nYou were intentionally hurtful. You apologize, without excuse or reservation, and THEN you can try to have a calm, respectful conversation about the other thing. \n\nAnd, SPOILER, every single disagreement ever involves two people who are both upset.

{"prompt":"How do I (M29) tell my ex (F30) I can't be friends with her anymore? Context: We broke up 3 months ago, only saw each other for 6 months but I was really invested in the relationship. She started a uni degree and found it too stressful to juggle uni, work, and a relationship with me. Totally fine with it at the time because she had grown quite distant.

So it's obviously quite an important relationship to her. \n\nMy dilemma is that I really like her again. But she is really happy.

{"prompt":"My (27F) long distance BF (34M) says he lost the connection we had, after a perfect weekend  \n\nHello! I am in major need of some advice. I (27F) met this man (34) who lives across the country on the internet - we had one mutual friend, so not complete strangers. We hit it off, and after just a few weeks of talking he booked a flight to come meet me.\n\nI will preface with this: he was previously married and in that relationship for 9 years, she cheated, and he has made it clear he has some trust and attachment issues, and he finds it hard to form a bond with people. He's also admitted he's typically the \"runner\" in a relationship and will leave instead of facing the issue, is not the best at communication and tends to shut down when he's sad or likes to avoid when people get emotional, etc. I, on the other hand, got out of a marriage as well and we were together for 10 years. With that said, never in those 10 years did I feel the way this man made me feel.\n\nIt was NYE weekend, and we had the best weekend ever. Great chemistry, a lot of passion, and when it was time to leave, we were both very sad. Soon after, he made it clear he wanted us to be exclusive and in a LDR. Just a few days after he left, I booked a flight to go see him. Meanwhile, we're texting everyday, on the phone as much as possible, etc. He invited me to go on a family vacation with him in a few months, told me I'm his favorite person, etc. Basically, everything was picture perfect. We talked about me moving there to be with him, our future dogs and farm animals we'd get - we were planning a future together.\n\nFast forward, to just last weekend when I flew out there - yet another perfect weekend. We stayed in a cabin in the mountains, and it was hot tub/campfire bliss. We'd spend hours cuddling each other in the morning and he'd look into my eyes and say cute things like \"I could do this all day.\" Dancing in the kitchen together while he cooked dinner. He was very affectionate, and lovey. We talked about moving in together, half-joked about having kids. Truly like a love story you'd see in the movies. Or so it seemed...\n\nThe day he took me to the airport, he didn't park in the lot and walk me in like I expected. He just did the drop off, got out gave me a passionate kiss, thanked me for the weekend and said he had a great time and off I went. At the moment, I felt in my gut something was off. After he left, he texted me again thanking me for everything. I ended up asking him if he wanted to see me again because I was getting a weird vibe. And he assured me, \"yes, of course I do, why wouldn't I?\"\n\nSo, we ended up not talking on the phone that night like we usually do. No biggie. We're still texting/sending each other funny videos/memes throughout the day as usual. Then the next night, it was a short phone call because we were both busy. I couldn't shake the feeling, so yesterday when he texted me the usual \"Good morning\" with a kissy face, I asked him what's going on because it seems like he's not wanting to make this work... He basically told me, \" I've been struggling and I don't know why. - I feel like I've lost the connection we had. There's not a specific reason. I had a great weekend with you and I don't know what happened but I don't think we're going to work out. \" And that was basically it. Now, I'm completely thrown off because the entire weekend he was acting obsessed with me. Other than my intuition telling me something was up, I would have never known. I was still getting my good morning and goodnight texts, and all the sweet relationship memes, etc.\n\nBasically, what am I to do... I was falling in love with this man, and he said he was too... And now I'm left to wonder what went wrong without really getting an answer. I would typically say, well if he's not willing to put the effort in neither am I. Except, I know about his commitment issues and think he might be running away from love because he's afraid to get hurt again. It's hard to condense all the info in this one post, but it's very hard to let go when I know he and I both felt how special our connection was. I'm just so confused now.\n\nI don't really know what I'm asking, I just wanted some outside opinions. Do I try and make this work and get to the bottom of what he's feeling? Or just let it go? I know I wasn't romanticizing and imagining what we had, it truly was amazing and if he had ever acted himself like it wasn't or he wasn't that into me, I'd understand but that just isn't how it went. Everything was absolutely perfect, until it wasn't. Which makes me think he's shutting down and pushing me away. This would be so much easier if I lived closer and could just go to his place and talk. :( It's hard to keep the spark alive while long distance, but I thought we were doing a good job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; My long-distance boyfriend with attachment issues said he \"lost the connection\" we had after we had a perfect weekend. I'm getting mixed signals and not sure if I should try or walk away.","completion":"&gt;he finds it hard to form a bond with people. He's also admitted he's typically the \"runner\" in a relationship and will leave instead of facing the issue, is not the best at communication and tends to shut down when he's sad or likes to avoid when people get emotional, etc.\n\nYou already know what happened.  He made it pretty clear that he can't do relationships.  You just didn't believe him.\n\nNow you know he was for real.  The guy can't do relationships.  Best to move on.\n\n&gt;I know I wasn't romanticizing and imagining what we had\n\nExcept... you definitely are?  You've known him for what, a few months at this point?  And you were planning a future with him?  The guy who said he is a runner?\n\nPassion is great but it's not really the foundation of a relationship.  Anyone can have some passionate days.  Relationships need real commitment though.  He's clearly not capable of this.  I mean hell, you haven't even gotten to the tough parts yet.  If he's already out now, no way would he last through the harder stuff."}

{"prompt":"Should I [26F] attend a family function with my parents to see my terminal aunt [60 F]? To put it simply, my parents were physically, verbally and emotionally spicy. I maintained a relationship with them anyway through college and until this year.\n\nI am on the cusp of breaking off that relationship because of repeated crossing of boundaries, using personal things against me, and consistent damage to my self esteem and well being.\n\nMy cousin is about to have a baby and invited me to their baby shower with the rest of the family. My aunt (the expectant grandmother) is terminally ill and may pass away soon. She is desperately excited for this event and the incoming baby and would love for me to attend. Due to COVID and schedules, I have not seen my aunt in around 4 years. Growing up, she visited me frequently and was the sole kind adult in my life.\n\nThe odds are low that I would visit her alone if not on this trip. I don't drive, and she can't drive anymore, and it would feel awkward, and there are also other factors I won't get into here.\n\nI'm still \"technically\" talking to my parents. I tried to stop, but my mom called and I answered, and she emailed and I answered, so I'm trying to reduce the contact but not cut them off altogether. As a result, I would feel hypocritical to skip the trip because of this. But at the same time, I will hate being enclosed in a hotel with them in-person and potentially not being able to easily escape conversations or sharing things with them when in group settings.\n\nOn the other hand, I may seriously regret it if I don't see my aunt again before she passes.\n\nI'll appreciate any advice or insight into this please.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I live out of state and would need to fly in, stay a hotel (same hotel with my parents), eat meals there and fly back probably the next day.\n\n**tl;dr Unsure whether to attend a family gathering to see a sick family member, when my parents are also there.**","completion":"Well on tinder you have to swipe that you're attracted to the other person so you have that in your favor.

My entire argument was that if she was to vocalize her concerned in a manner prudent to our situation it would have been a question. her reaction was far too dismissive for my social expectations. and very similar to our past circumstances.\n\nI was pushy, I was sick of it, I felt that our previous conversations were the end of this 'thing'.\n\nI'm aware that I'm not being compromising, I don't think games are so serious. even in the most competitive of games, among friends, are meaningless. I've taking dismissal of our comradery to be more meaningful then losing a simple board game.\n\nso my question or my concern is.\n\nAm i to submit to a lifetime of single player board games among couples, or should I double down and ask that she be more involved with my friend group.\n\nplease note that in the past this occurs with both her friends and mine. the only difference is I feel the need to defend my significant others stance more with my friends than her friends as they already understand her enough. should i take a leaf from their book? i don't know this just happened and I'm still stewing forgive me.\n\nThank you i appreciate your opinion.","completion":"So as I said in the post I asked pretty directly before which just made him quite sheepish and I’m looking for advice on how to approach the matter as I only know how to be upfront."}

{"prompt":"On a break but falling back in love me 27F him 24M My boyfriend and I were dating for almost four years. He broke up with me last year because he was overwhelmed and needed to focus on himself. He’s a business owner and was working another job that was causing him to have to cancel on me cause he had to work.  We got back together on the first day of both of our new jobs and our second time around was so much better, but I hadn’t gotten over the breakup.  Now I feel like I’m in the same situation. I work 40 hours a week and am taking tests for my teaching certificate.  And am taking a class. Now literally putting myself in his position is  giving me time to heal. I understand people need to focus on themselves. I want him back but I haven’t  taken the tests yet.

Don't get involved in how she spends her money - then you won't be aggravated by her spending.\n\nIf you love your wife, you will find some of these things quirky, find a work around and move on.

{"prompt":"I (22f) fucked my coworker (27m) and he is being weird. Hey so me and this guy have been flirting for a while, my friend was also flirting with him. We were just having fun. Yesterday in a party me and her thought let's get this guy to bed, not together. So we both flirted, he seemed more interested in me so she gave him up for me. We flirted the entire night, we were both 5-6 drinks down, he had also preboozed. \n\nHe got very touchy and we also grind a bit while dancing which is awful in retrospect since there were other colleagues there too. Im just hoping they were also too drunk to remember or notice. \n\nThen i asked him let's leave. So me, him, my friend and his friend went to his place. We made out in the car. At his place we drank a bit more, then the two of us went into a room. We started making out, we had sex and all of that. \n\nHe got real rough with his fingers, my period date was also close so they came. So i bled a lot and I'm pretty sure i got hurt also. So i went to clean up.\n\nHe was shit faced so he slept off by the time i came back. I wore my clothes, put a blanket on him and went outside to get a tampon from my bag, the other two were still sitting there, chatting. \n\nI put in the tampon, took off his glasses and his watch and slept beside him.\n\nIn the morning when we woke up, he had a hard on, he was still kinda in his sleep, hewas rubbing it against me. But I had a tampon in and stuff so i backed off a little. Then he got up said good morning, went to the washroom, did stuff around the house, not a word from his mouth. I noticed a light hickey on me and 3-4 v dark ones on him. And we're both in complicated relationships. I left soon, he gave me an awkward side hug and said bye. \n\nI called my friend and told her all that had happened, she told me he was on MDMA. He did it before he came to the party. He later texted her saying \"I dont even know how i got into that room, who let me go inside, it's all blurry, i don't remember\" and shit like that. She told me not to tell him that i know what he said to her because they work together closely and she can't afford losing his trust.\n\nWe both got really pissed. She said he wasn't that drunk that he wouldn't remember. I felt really bad and guilty because he was making it sound like i had forced him or he didn't want that. She said he's saying all that to her so that things dont get awkward between them and he was justifying his drunk horny behaviour in front of everyone.\n\nThen at 3 pm he texted me for a video i made in the party, i sent it at 5 and he said thanks. Then an hour later he texted me to ask if im alright. I did not reply, he sent me some reels on instagram also and i left them on read. \n\nWHAT DO I DO?","completion":"You got two options....\n\nMake peace that noone will do things as you want them - and do them yourself, and for what she does let her deal with it. Release the control.\n\nOption two is keep nagging, get her common sense for dummies and cleaning house for dummies, but she wont stay in marriage like that.\n\nYou cannot expect others to be you or like you in those situations. When you marry, you also marry for the worsts, are these sonething you can live with? Especially if you guys have kids?? Baby brain will make this so much worse fyi.\n\nSo i hope you can meet somewhere in the middle, noone woukdve taught her those thongs, so maybe teach her to rtfm - read the f****** manual before using or cleaning any items, areas etc. \n\nFollowing basic instructions will be easier if she learns to read labels etc. Second step is educating her on information security. Third, all else."}

We have been through a lot but when I was small, she made my life hell. She made me suicidal. I couldn't focus on studies and just hoped something would kill me at that point of my life. I still don't remember much about a huge chunk of my past.\n\nI moved to an another city but it brought it's own problems.  I ultimately attempted suicide few years ago and survived and she took care of me when I could not even walk. I was grateful for that and we fixed our relationship. She said sorry for the past and I forgave her. \n\nShe got a boyfriend and he was really caring and good. He was like a father I never had. But he died 1 year ago. I still feel bad for not been there for her. I told her to move on which was stupid of me. \n\n\nAnyways I got a fear of blood and I once fainted in a clinic while giving my blood test. She was there and she saw it.\nSince then she got a new fear that something will happen to me and she will lose me too.\n\n\nShe wants me to call her and inform her about everything I do and if I don't take the call like if I am outside or not around the phone which does happen a lot. She ends up calling everyone and they ends up checking up for me. I love her that she cares for me but it has turned into such an issue. It's like what if I'm in some meeting or in college. I can't pick up my phone and well I ask her to get over her fear and I'm ready to help her in any way possible but she doesn't want to. She wants me to message her beforehand whenever I may not be able to take the call and it is not possible for me. First of all, I feel trapped and second I often forget it, cuz I mean it isn't feasible for me. Let's say I have to go out to get something and I leave my phone home. I would be thinking about the things I have to buy and not about calling her to tell her that I'm going out and leaving my phone home. \n\n\nThe second problem is that whenever we talk on call, she just talks about one thing. She worries about even the smallest of problems a lot, she always scolds me for not calling her more often and telling her about my routine (I don't feel comfortable sharing my daily routine idk why). I also try to call her daily but come on. I won't be talking to her in the morning when I have works to do but she wants me to do that. I usually talk in the evening. And man if I skip a day or two, she gets annoyed and angry. I didn't call her the last two days cuz I was busy doing something and got tired. She made it such a huge matter on call today. \n\n\nWhenever we talk, we ends up fighting. I often feel annoyed whenever I have to call her cuz I know I'll just be talking about the same old things. Also I have told her that we can talk about other things like we can talk about movies, world news, my video games or just random chats but it's just the same old talks. \nI got angry on phone today and she told me that she won't ask me about my routine again. I felt like she was telling me that in a manipulative way. Idk I felt manipulative.\n\n\nShe have done and sacrificed a lot for me. I'm not perfect and neither is she.

I still don't remember much about a huge chunk of my past.\n\nI moved to an another city but it brought it's own problems.  I ultimately attempted suicide few years ago and survived and she took care of me when I could not even walk. I was grateful for that and we fixed our relationship. She said sorry for the past and I forgave her. \n\nShe got a boyfriend and he was really caring and good. He was like a father I never had. But he died 1 year ago. I still feel bad for not been there for her. I told her to move on which was stupid of me. \n\n\nAnyways I got a fear of blood and I once fainted in a clinic while giving my blood test. She was there and she saw it.\nSince then she got a new fear that something will happen to me and she will lose me too.\n\n\nShe wants me to call her and inform her about everything I do and if I don't take the call like if I am outside or not around the phone which does happen a lot. She ends up calling everyone and they ends up checking up for me. I love her that she cares for me but it has turned into such an issue. It's like what if I'm in some meeting or in college. I can't pick up my phone and well I ask her to get over her fear and I'm ready to help her in any way possible but she doesn't want to.

I would be thinking about the things I have to buy and not about calling her to tell her that I'm going out and leaving my phone home. \n\n\nThe second problem is that whenever we talk on call, she just talks about one thing. She worries about even the smallest of problems a lot, she always scolds me for not calling her more often and telling her about my routine (I don't feel comfortable sharing my daily routine idk why). I also try to call her daily but come on. I won't be talking to her in the morning when I have works to do but she wants me to do that. I usually talk in the evening. And man if I skip a day or two, she gets annoyed and angry. I didn't call her the last two days cuz I was busy doing something and got tired. She made it such a huge matter on call today. \n\n\nWhenever we talk, we ends up fighting. I often feel annoyed whenever I have to call her cuz I know I'll just be talking about the same old things. Also I have told her that we can talk about other things like we can talk about movies, world news, my video games or just random chats but it's just the same old talks. \nI got angry on phone today and she told me that she won't ask me about my routine again.

{"prompt":"[30M] [28F] How to cope with a 6 week period of low contact and no chance of meeting TL;DR: Boyfriend of 2 months goes on vacation for 6 weeks and will only be on his phone once or twice a week. I'm nervous and don't know how to cope.\n\nHello people of reddit, \n\nMy (28f) boyfriend (30m) of about 2 1/2 months is going on a 6 week vacation alone on some very remote islands on the other side of the world at the beginning of March. This vacation has been planned long before we even met, it's to celebrate a huge educational achievement of his and to recharge and get away before he starts his career. I fully understand and fully support him, he's incredibly excited and I'm happy for him. It's so cute watching him beam at the sight of pictures of his destination! \n\nProblem is: I'm a very \"close\" person, meaning i like to have a lot of contact with partners, meet up quite often (Of course while each keeping their own life), and tend to miss my partner rather quickly. I've never had a LDR or even such a period of not seeing each other in any relationship before. Also after 2-3 months, obviously the relationship isn't as strong yet. We're very much in love and very serious, but we're also still figuring out how we work together as a team, how to best communicate with the other person, the quirks etc.   \nMy boyfriend did say he considered leaving his phone off while he's there, but i said that no contact at all would be disastrous for the relationship IMO, also he does want to know if he gets any important letters so doesn't work either way. I think he was just a bit annoyed with his mum (not the best relationship with her) and wanted to turn his phone off to get away from her. But he won't be online every day, likely only when there's WiFi and only like once or twice per week. He'll of course also be in a time zone like 10 hours different from here.\n\nBut already the facts like that, not seeing each other at all for 6 weeks and this low contact, likely no possibility to talk on the phone due to time zones, makes me nervous. Rn we're meeting up pretty much every weekend, tho not always the whole weekend, plus sometimes one day during the week, texting daily and on the phone multiple times a week. \nI know 6 weeks won't be long for many people who've had longer separations or LDR, but I've not experienced anything like that so it's a lot for me, especially this early in a relationship. \n\nHow do you cope with that? What's important to communicate beforehand? Anyone experienced something similar and wished afterwards they'd done something different?\n\n Right no we've talked about boundaries when he meets people there (dancing with women and obv talking is fine with me, heavy flirting and anything physical isn't, he agreed earnestly and said those would be his natural boundaries as well, but did make some weird jokes to try and test my reaction). I'm planning on not taking time off work while he's away, and when I'm not working trying to meet up with friends and otherwise playing videogames (fittingly my most played game gets a huge patch mid March lol). \n\nBtw I can't come with him nor can I come visit him there for a short period of time, i don't have any spare money at all.","completion":"I was in a LDR for 12 months, 8 hour time difference. 6 weeks is, to be quite frank, nothing to me anymore. Not after I have been thinking in half year terms before.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like an absolutely amazing journey he has got ahead of himself. One he needs for his own life, his own development, something that has nothing to do with you and the relationship and I think that is how you should deal with this as well. I would want to give my partner the exact freedom they feel they need on a journey like that and let them reach out when they have time and cherish those moments. Missing each other is not necessarily a bad thing and can make the reunion that more special.\n\nYou have nothing to be afraid of really. But I am also a person that is more than fine by himself and I would not say no to 6 weeks just to myself once in a while in a relationship."}
{"prompt":"Should I (F18) cut off contact with my best friend (F19) of 10+ years? My best friend who i’ll call Lizzy has a boyfriend who i’ll call James. Lizzy and James have been together since August 2022, they’ve never met in person. Lizzy and I have been best friends since 2nd grade, we’re in high school now. She’s had a lot of boyfriends who all tend to be a-holes. Including James. James is one of the rudest people i’ve ever met, and he’s best friend with my ex who i’ll call Dameon. James and I constantly fight when we’re speaking to each other so I cut off contact with him, it’s very limited and only for/about Lizzy when we do speak. Dameon and I still talk sometimes just to catch up, earlier today Lizzy texted me and said we need to talk. She then went on to say how Dameon told James that I constantly talk bad about James, and all this stuff which isn’t really true. Yes, I say I don’t like James but he tells me to unalive myself almost every time we talk, and Lizzy knows I don’t like him. Well basically, she started yelling at me about how it doesn’t matter what I think about James and how I need to never speak about him again and all this stuff. I continuously tried to tell her the truth but she wouldn’t listen. I’m honestly just scared she’s going to drop me again, she has dropped me multiple times for her ex boyfriends and she’s acting like she’s going to do it again. I love her she’s my best friend, I would take a bullet for her and honest it hurts a lot to know she would just drop me for any guy who hasn’t even been around longer than a year. I’m pretty sure Dameon is telling her this all to get me and her to stop talking because he doesn’t like Lizzy at all and he always says he doesn’t like her. James seems like he would honestly make her pick between me and him and i know she would probably pick him which hurts more than anything because i have dropped guys for her in the past. i’m considering cutting off all contact with Lizzy and i blocked Dameon already. I just don’t want to get hurt by her actions again it seems to be a repeat thing when she gets into relationships. She drops me for them, learns they aren’t who she thought then she comes back. I always let her back in because we’ve been best friends since we were little and it’s hard to be away from her every time. \n\nShould I cut off all contact with Lizzy to protect myself?","completion":"I am the first partner she hasn’t cheated on"}

{"prompt":"I (23M) still have feelings for my ex (21F) I met my ex over tinder about 3 years ago. I was 20 and she was 18.\n We talked on Snapchat and FaceTimed almost every day. I didn’t meet her in person until a year had passed because I am in the military and she lived 5 hours away. \n\nSo obviously this relationship was doomed from the start and we were a lot dumber 3 years ago. She had just graduated high school and I had just got into the military. Both of us were introduced to different worlds and we were in a reckless phase. It was pretty childish to think things would work out fine with the distance being an issue.\n\nThe first time we met in person it felt like we were already together. Kissed her…a lot. Went to the dog park with her and my dog and talked for hours.\n\nFast forward a month and we are talking over the phone still. I finally come back home on leave and pick her up for a second date. We went to the movies and fooled around a bit.\n Then after that day I didn’t see nor talk to her for 6 months. She started leaving me on read and giving one word responses. I got REALLY needy and asked her why she’s been quiet. She played it off like she was just really busy but I think she was just too nice to admit that it wasn’t working out.\n\nI eventually got really depressed for a whole 2 years and had a manic episode followed by a bipolar diagnosis.\nDuring this manic episode, I was drinking a lot and telling her how I think we could change the world and all this crazy stuff. \n\n I was hospitalized for a week until I was doing better. \n\nAfter I got myself together about a month later, I hit her up and apologized over Snapchat. \nShe was very understanding and told me if I ever want to talk or hang out just to ask.\n\nSo a month later I went to her place just to talk. Honestly thought it would feel more intimate, but I just helped her set up her new apartment. Later in the night we drank a little and then she fell asleep in her bed. I woke her up and told her I was leaving. I hugged her and that was the last time I saw her. \n\nI feel like the distance is the only thing that kept us from being together and now that I’m separating from the military and moving back home, I can’t help but think maybe me and her have unfinished business.

{"prompt":"My (33f) BF (33m) won't let me see his chat history with another woman My BF (33m) and I (33f) have been together about 1 1/2 years. The day before yesterday was his birthday and while we were hanging out he was reading and responding to birthday messages on his phone. This was when I noticed he had archived chats on WhatsApp, including one with a girl that he apparently knows from school who wished him happy birthday with a kiss and heart emoji. I also noticed their messages before than were LONG, which surprised me because my BF is not a big texter and we have argued about him not texting me back or saying very much. \n\nI asked him why he had these chats archived and 'hidden' on WhatsApp and he said it's because they are chats with people he doesn't talk to anymore (which I still don't get the reasoning for) and the chat with this woman is there because they only talk sporadically. But it was ab active chat, so why put it there? \n\nHe tried to reassure me that I don't need to worry, he loves me and wants only me, but it was unsettling. Since it was his birthday, I didn't bring it up again until yesterday. I told him I found it weird and suspicious, and asked whether I could read some of their chat history so I could know there was nothing going on. He said no. \n\nHis reason is because they talk about personal things, including our relationship and he has complained about me to her, so he doesn't want me to see it. It makes him uncomfortable. Of course the whole thing makes me very uncomfortable and triggers my insecurities. He says I just have to trust him, but I am finding that extremely difficult right now. \n\nNot sure if I am looking for advice or just an outside perspective... Should I insist that he let me read their messages? Or is that wrong of me to push for because it violates his privacy?\n\nUpdate: I told him it still bothered me and I needed space. He said he didn't want me to see the chat history because he had asked this woman for advice on messages he sent to his Ex-GF (before we got together) which doesn’t make sense because that would mean I would have to read back like 2 years. He then sent me Screenshots of some of their chat history to try to appease me but things were obviously cut out and his messages suggest she had sent him pictures. He also talked about things we did together as if he had done them alone.","completion":"No need to tell your ex. You should probably clap ur friends cheeks tho."}

He says they’re archived (not only dumb but weird), because they essentially never talk, but when they do, it’s “sporadically.” Just like you, I think that “logic” makes absolutely no sense but let’s continue on.  He’s established here that this person is an acquaintance at best that he rarely talks to. \n\nYou then ask to see the chat, and he says they talk about personal things including your relationship. But he literally just said this person is someone he never talks to and he’s not close with. You talk about your relationship issues with people you’re not close with? Hmm. \n\nAt this point, I assure you any incriminating messages have been deleted, and he might even hope you ask so that he can “prove” how crazy you are. You might even want to try that, because if he hands it over quickly, it’s because all is good. \n\nRegardless, you don’t trust him. Right or wrong, you think somethings off based on what you know.

{"prompt":"My (F25) bestfriend’s (M25) parent was caught cheating and I don’t recognize him. How do I help him Hi everyone, \nMy bsf is going through something very rough for him and his family rn, it was revealed that his dad had an affair for the past few years. His parents haven been married for over 20 years and they seemed like the perfect family really, so its very hard on him. He feels like his whole family was ruined, that the people he loves the most, and him have been hurt and two people are responsible for that: his dad and the other woman.\n\nNow, he’s one of the most kind hearted person I know, but he doesn’t take offense/harm (done to him or someone in his circle) lightly, and he is revengeful.\n\nUnfortunately in this case, the wrong that has been done cannot be returned; and he has a pressing need to hurt them both so that he can feel like he’s not just being subject to the injustice and not fighting back. \n\nHe has done investigations to find the woman (despite the dad’s efforts to protect her). He initially intended on blackmailing her but her family knows about the affair as well. Now he’s looking for ways to torment her and I am sure the only things stopping him from physically attacking her are 1) That would be breaking the law and 2) He feels like physical pain is too temporary and merciful. \n\nI get being revengeful, but I do not like harming others more than the extent of the consequences of their actions. I also fear he does something he might regret in the future. He knows this, and has stopped telling me about some of his plans because he doesn’t want to defend himself and he feels like I am judging him.\n\nHe has her number and sent her an order to meet him somewhere. She obviously didn’t come. He went to her workplace to catch her and couldn’t get in. He told me these things after the facts so I wouldn’t try to stop him. \n\nNow, I am avoiding the “Are you sure about this” talks so he doesn’t completely shut me off. He also has been surprisingly more calm and composed than the rest of his family, and I fear he might break at some point and I would not be able to be there for him if that happens.\n\nI know I cannot really stop him but I am worried about him. I feel like he’s focusing more on the woman than her dad, and I fear he never gets to inflict to them any distress that would be enough for him to be okay with it. \n\nI don’t know how to help him, I feel useless. He’s able to rant with me and he appreciates that but the more time passes without him having done anything to them, the more tense/agitated he gets. It’s the only thing on his mind. I don’t know where to go from now. What should I tell him ? How can I help ?","completion":"For real? Dude, it's her body, she gets to do with it what she wants."}

When I returned home to my boyfriend I hoped he would be wowed by how I looked and we would have a romantic evening. Instead I felt awkward because he was nonplussed.\n\nWe had some conflict and from my perspective he was more interested in his laptop than spending time with me. I isolated myself in my bedroom, which I recognise isn't healthy, but I felt incredibly uncomfortable. Silly, in fact, that I had gone to some effort and it wasn't appreciated.\n\nI love my boyfriend very much and he is a good man. We have a generally good relationship and communicate incredibly most of the time.\n\nWhen we have conflict he needs space and I crave resolution and closure.

He lives 75 miles away. I tried to understand what the space looked like to him to help me regulate and also meet his needs, but he just said he needed to be alone.\n\nI messaged him a couple of hours later and said I respect his need for space but could he support me by telling me he got home safe and also that it was space he needed and not the end of our relationship. I struggle very much to regulate myself, but try so hard.\n\nI haven't heard from him since and my need for resolution is heightened. I'm highly triggered at the moment and struggling because of my past. It's hard to explain that it's my past and not the current situation that leave me feeling the way I do.\n\nI just want to fix things, and staying silent with each other doesn't seem to be fixing anything.\n\nI'm aware that I'm triggered right now and I have all the symptoms that CPTSD brings. I'm hypervigilant, thoughts of self harm/suicide and I'm spiralling.\n\nI want to be better where dealing with our issues is concerned and I want to not be triggered.

Time is the only thing that can heal your pain and help you get over your feelings. It may seem like it will take forever but it will happen.

I'd thought about this some more and felt like perhaps she didn't even care. She has a lot of friends, girls and guys, that's been a tight group for a while. I was the new guy in the circle after this situation I felt like \"what's it to her? I'm probably just another dude that confessed\" and since she didn't feel the same way she still has our other friends to turn to. But I also didn't expect, like in your situation, that it would hurt her as much either as I just saw myself as some guy in her life as opposed to her losing a close friend as well. I don't know though, I wish there was another way. I tried the whole slight distance thing and it didn't work so this was the only option I saw.\n\nEDIT: I do hope that one day I'm able to re-connect with her as you and your friend were able to! I'm glad your friendship was able to stand through the trial of time and I'm sure it wasn't easy, but it must be amazing now that you've made it past the tribulation. Best wishes to you both!"}
{"prompt":"My bf’s girl “friend”? F23 M28 My new boyfriend, only been dating for a month, invited me to meet his friend along with her other friends. I asked him how they met which I could tell from his demeanor that I should’ve predicted it. He told me they use to have a thing together. I laughed, from being uncomfortable and having never been in that situation before. I asked if they slept together, which he said “yes, but we met after I got out of a long term relationship and we realized we were better off friends because a relationship wouldn’t work between us. We haven’t been involved like that in 2 years” \nHis answer didn’t make me feel better but being a new couple I don’t want to accuse him of not having my trust but I have serious trust issues after getting out of a physical and verbal abusive relationship over a year ago. I really like him and I could see us having a strong relationship but this new revelation is making me uneasy and uncomfortable.

I asked him to go to therapy. He’s got major anger issues and uses weed to cope. Which is fine, but if he goes more than 24 hrs without smoking… that’s when things get intense. He’s never hurt me and has never threatened to hit me, abuse me, or anything. I’m not worried about that, just him breaking expensive stuff. IE one time he ripped up his favor bag and it cost like 80 bucks. We don’t/didn’t have the money to replace. We also are long distance right now after we broke up and he has no intention of moving closer to me (I have a really nice paying job and won’t find something similar pay to it back home).

It all came down to learning a mental exercise that I was to do every 30 minutes for several weeks.\n\nAn exercise where I ask myself,\n\n* How do I feel?\n* Why do I feel this way?\n* Is it valid to feel this?\n* What should I do next?

I had spent the morning cleaning up and when it was time for him to arrive, he didn’t show up, despite me calling him multiple times. When he did check my texts, he said he had accidentally slept in and that he would visit the next day. I was upset since I wasted the morning waiting for him and got mad at him. He only said sorry after I told him I cleaned up and was waiting for him. The first text from him wasn’t even a sorry, it was “I KO. Was going to get up but fell asleep again”. I was upset with him for the rest of the day and didn’t really engage with his text (kind of sent him a dry reply). The next day, he didn’t even text me the whole day until I texted him first in the evening. Valentine’s day is coming up and he hasn’t even mentioned doing something special, so I’m not even sure if I should put in effort to do something special for him. \n\nSometimes it feels like i’m not even in a relationship with him and I’m not sure if I should continue with this. I’m honestly waiting until after valentine’s day to see where this goes but any advice until then?","completion":"I don’t think it will bc my being isn’t something I’m out and proud about, only 1 of my friends knows outside of the fiancé"}
{"prompt":"BF (28m) and I (29f), dating 4 years but we have different values.

They often talk about how it's not funny, it's in inappropriate moments, it ruins intimacy or sexual moments, that it's a huge turn off, etc. And everyone in the comments of those posts supports the poster to speak to their partner, and let them know how annoying/upsetting/frustrating/whatever it is to them, and make it clear that they need the behaviour to stop. \n\nNow... I think that's something you should consider. However, I also think your real issue is that he criticises you in other ways, and this feels like more of the same. **He clearly wants you to be something you're not.** So...while I would normally say to ditch the silly voice, in this case, I think you need to seriously consider the guy as a whole. He doesn't seem to like who you are, I will agree with that assessment. And you shouldn't date someone who wants to change you. (To clarify, little annoying habits like this voice? Fine to ask a partner to change. Big clothes and attitude adjustments? Absolutely an unacceptable request.)"}

He's been cold with me recently and i've been hearing friends talk about him having sex and having another boyfriend, i used to address this but it'd put him in a bad mood and nothing would come of it anyway, so i've stopped and have acknowledged the reality and just cope with it now.

(trigger warning for icide) Since hes been there, he has attempted 3 times over the course of months, and i dont know how to help him, he wont talk to me so all i can do is just be there for him, so i just do not like bringing up any topics that might put him in a bad mood.\n\nThis has then caused us to have virtually no communication in our relationship, and since we've been talking, i've heard his friends in the background make offhand comments like \"black boyfriend\"(not talking about me, were white and the black connects with another comment) and \"you fuck alot in the past weeks\" \"you fuck way more than me\" and \"im not black, but i know thats your taste\" and usually when they say these things, he mutes as soon as he can and starts making noise into the mic trying to pass it off as him being goofy, but i always hear it, and sometimes he'll mute just in case they say anything and i can see him being paranoid, i used to comment on this when i heard it, but when i do it always puts him in a bad mood and he is usually dismissive.\n\nI never wanted to believe it before but now its just gotten to a point where i've just acknowledged its true and i know hes cheating and im just trying to cope and live with this reality and distract myself from it. I do not want to talk to him about it, because it'll make him think about how much hes done to me and if i seem in pain from it, he'll blame himself for it and hate himself and get really depressive, and he'll get in a bad mood because i reminded him of the topic, and i am scared beyond belief that he'll attempt again.\n\nEven without that fear, i dont want to lose him, so if i could talk to him about it, i would want us to talk it out so i can relieve him and tell him i forgive him but that i need time to trust again and im hoping that addressing it and moving on will help him to be less cold towards me. I want us to recover from this, but i cant even address it without putting him in a horrible mood or without him blaming himself.","completion":"It's entirely possible you're the best she ever had.

A week ago he said something that I really didn't like and instead of talking to him about it normally I lashed out to him (yelling, crying),  I do that a lot of times when I don't like something (and don't get me wrong, I know it's bad to react like this --not only in a romantic relationship but every kind of relationship--) and I apologized. He didn't like my reaction and this has happened once before already but he didn't mention anything. Last night we talked about it and he said he doesn't know what he wants yet and that I should wait a little bit, but it is most likely that we will break up. If we actually break up I already know I will be very empty for a while. I know it kinda goes the same for him too. I know \"I'm too young\" to worry about stuff like this and I have a lot to learn and so on but I really don't want to lose him. He means a lot to me and I love him, not as my boyfriend but as a person, he's always been there. I'm gonna wait a bit and hope everything turns out well but any advice would really help me.    \n\n\n I'm sorry if I have any spelling mistakes, english isn't my first language","completion":"Quite frankly, that kink would be a shock to many people, and she didn't know how to process it.\n\nSo, she panicked and said something stupid.\n\nI have a different take on her pictures: she is stretching her own limits to please you, and that is a good thing. She also wants to show you that she no longer judges you for your kink. These are good qualities in a partner.\n\nYou should consider speaking to her, BUT therapy would definitely help you after such a tough emotional time growing up."}

{"prompt":"I (m27) am not sure if I should keep the relationship going with my (f25) gf So we’ve been together for about 9 months. To make a long story short, I met her through my then best friend who liked her as well, but they didn’t really mesh well. We naturally meshed a lot better and we pursued a relationship together. Had a messy situation and a fall out with my friend eventually happened, leaving all of us really stressed and overwhelmed. I’ve been able to handle this situation a lot better than she has (she’s depressed, less talkative, lost her job, significantly less intimate) she blames herself for the fallout between my friend and I even tho I tell her it’s not her fault. but since the incident she has been acting shady. She’ll only reply to me in certain hours of the day, seems detached, will disappear and just be like ohh my phone is dead or will say she was busy doing something but not say what. Now these are red flags in my mind but also know these are signs of depression. Idk what to do because every time I mention any of these topics she just shuts down and give me a short answer and changes the conversation. I really do love her and I don’t want to end the relationship because she’s really special to me even through the ups and downs. I’m hoping this is just me projecting my insecurities. It’s hard to bring this up because I do understand she’s depressed and maybe just doesn’t know how to deal with it and cope.

Your feelings are valid, and if I was sick and my bf left me to be with friends I would probably feel a bit upset too.\n\nHOWEVER,\n\nIn relationships it’s important to occasionally sacrifice. Even if this isn’t really fair and how you feel is valid, sometimes you just gotta let things go. I think this is one of those situations, because he hasn’t seen these people in a very long time and it’s unlikely that he’ll be able to see them again for another long time. Since you’re all from different countries, it sounds like these plans can be difficult to make.\n\nSo, basically what I’m saying is, it’s not wrong for you to feel this way, but at the same time you need to cut him some slack here. I hope this helped :)"}

I just want to know if she would date me and if we could make a good couple.\n\nRecently our friend group met up for the first time in a while and our friends helped her put together a Hinge profile. She had never used a dating app before and was finally ready to start dating again. She texted us later that day and said she already had like 30 likes.\n\nA few days later she said over text that she had met someone that she's really excited about and was asking for advice. She and I send each other funny Instagram reels periodically, but I sent her a few over the past few days and she left me on read and it hurts. I feel like she's probably focusing on this other dude and I'm too late.\n\nSorry if this is rambling I'm just bummed and don't know what to do. I feel like she's not into me and I don't understand why. Based on what I observe, I feel like I should be pretty much exactly her type. Any kind words or advice appreciated.","completion":"That’s a good thing. Was worried she already had someone picked out. If you’re both into it, then why not. Each to their own and all that."}

{"prompt":"I (22 NB) have a crush on a girl (27 F) that doesn't like me So, i'll summarize. In 2019 i met a girl on a dance class, and we shared the routine of going from the dance class to the university because we also did the same carrer, so we implicitly decided to share that hour between the two things. We got to meet each other over time, and i fell over heels for her. I did it perfectly knowing she had a boyfriend, a 9 years relationship with a dude i don't know. She was 24 at the time, and i was 18 (currently 22). I couldn't handle pretending i didn't feel anything for her and that i wanted to remain friends, so i just told her that i liked her. She respectfully rejected me, of course, and that was that. \n\nThe next year i dropped the carrer because of the social distancing of 2020, but she kept doing it despite that. We lost touch and only very ocassionaly talked through Instagram. I went over to dedicate myself to dancing, i started another carrer to become a dance teacher that i also dropped last year. Before that, in 2021, i came out as non-binary (AMAB) and kept identifying myself as such since. \n\nThe problem is: despite knowing that nothing was ever going to happen between us, I never really stoped liking her, and that's the worst. I feel like i keep on with this \"love\" in my head because truth is, i have nothing else. No one ever really shook the ground for me like she did. And i'm kind of a shy and closed off person, that doesn't really open that much to people and always had problems getting the courage to actually start dating someone. Her apparition in my life kind of felt like a beautiful lightning bolt, some once in a lifetime shit, mainly because us meeting was a coincidence. \n\nNo coincidence ever resembled that one since. Some dark part in my head tells me that this is a really fcked up obsession, meant only to hurt me and tell me that i'm worthless, and that my experience with love will always be this; some sad platonic longing. (if you couldn't tell, i suffer from ✨️depression✨️) \n\nThing is, she reappeared in my life. I kept taking dance classes of as many kinds as i could despite dropping the carrer - dancing is just a part of me, it's something i need. And last week, i saw her leaving through the door of the studio. I asked if that was who i thought it was to the receptionist, and that was in fact her. Somehow i felt excited,  knowing that i would have the chance to see her and talk to her again. The next day we encountered in the meantime between classes, and talked. All was good, i was pleased, even though i was an awkward slob through all the talk. \n\nAnd now i'm confused. I fell back into the anxiety inducing thought of wether she would like for me to talk to her or not, given how i feel like she has been avoiding coming across me in the studio these last classes. I feel like a burden, this annoying person that wants something with her that is impossible. \n\nI really want to see her, just let our bond be what is has to be; but i can't avoid wanting something more, even after all these years. I don't know if i'm projecting some petty need for intimacy of mine onto her, or if all of this fcking fascination i feel for her is real; i don't even know if she is still in a relationship or not. \n\nSo my question is, should i try to talk to her, invite her over to a coffee or something, see what happens - whether i like what happens or not; or should i just let her be and try to forget? I tried, oh my, i tried to stop myself from feeling all this. These feelings over time became an annoyance, some kind of awful poison for the head; wich makes me more nervous when i'm around her than it should. \n\nso yeah.

He wanted to stay with her so he tried persuading her to have an abortion, which she didn’t and now has a child. \n\nFast forward, he reaches out to her monthly, and they talk over the phone. They keep in touch regarding life, family and business. They give each other advice. This includes my fiancé asking her for advice regarding OUR relationship. Once we were having a disagreement about finances and I  saw that he texted her “why are relationships so hard” and then I saw they had a 30 minute conversation on the phone together. After that conversation, he was more open to seeing my perspective I think so perhaps she is non biased.\n\nI only really started to feel uncomfortable when he supported her business—she makes crocheted toys. He paid $100 for her to make him a pillow. But this was a “boob pillow”.  He never told me about this purchase and I come home and see very realistic detailed breasts that are 3x bigger than mine, with nipple piercing. He says he bought them from her and is confused when I’m shocked and hurt by this.\n\nI told him this is getting much and he needs to stop talking to her. And his response is that she’s his only real female friend, the only female in his life from which he can get a genuine perspective. \n\nObviously I would feel bad for forcing him to cut off a genuine friend. But I feel like some important boundaries are being violated. \n\n\n\nPlease advise\n\n\nEdit- I should mention that I asked him, what’s keeping him from getting back with her. His response? “We’ll she lives in another state and has a baby, [etc]”. I was kinda disturbed that I was not mentioned anywhere in his answer until I called him out on it","completion":"You pay rent and bills.\n\nMaybe buy groceries, and get a car.  Leave the keys on the kitchen table.  But tickets for a cruise, somewhere tropical...2 tickets, but don't go.  Leave THOSE on the table as well.\n\nClean the place up....its a mess.  Make sure dinner is ALWAYS ready when they get home....."}

You've mentioned some bad stuff they did but you're kind of dismissive of it.  Also, you claim that they changed, but it sounds like they didn't change at all; they just treat spouses differently from non-spouse SOs.  So they're still AHs in general, they just aren't mistreating him in that way anymore now that he's married to you.  I think probably YTA but obviously I don't know them.\n\nOne question to ask yourself is if he would agree with your characterization of your parents or if he sees things completely differently.

Any guy of that age should know better than to blame a woman for being hit on. That happens a lot. My wife is hit on even if we're out together.

The type of jealousy here is something a 18-21 year old might have, not someone closing in on 30.\n\nEdit just saw you've been together for 8 years: that is some high insecurity for such a long relationship\n\nEDIT again: he started dating you when you were 16? I know it's not a big age gap but I still feel like dating a 16 year old is weird. Is he controlling in other ways?

My parents have been very kind, complimentary, and extremely generous. They've fully paid for vacations, restaurants, sent us home cooked meals when I was stressed, and respected our privacy and our decisions (since getting married). They have gifted their other grandkids everything they want, expensive gaming systems, you name it.  Now my mom does get pissed off if we turn them down repeatedly and my husband feels like that's manipulative (repeatedly, not now and then), but from my perspective, how hard is it to enjoy their gifts and say thank you and be pleasant? They never ask for anything from us in return, they just enjoy treating family. I get wanting boundaries but I feel like my husband takes it to the extreme for no reason sometimes."}

You need an honest answer to that type of question. But you’ve already coached him that he needs to be careful answering questions about her, so he may not be honest. \n\nMaybe ask him if he thinks he would get back with her if he could. Start the conversation after a few drinks and tell him something about one of your old relationships so that it is more of a conversation and not an inquisition. Ask him questions and let him talk. You want to find how strong his feelings are for her. You are not looking for the answer to a yes/no question. Or you could do a hypothetical question. What would he do if you two broke up.

Last August when we first met, I stopped talking to him because I said I didn’t feel comfortable with him having a Situationship while we are getting to know each other and he claimed he stopped talking to her from that point. I took a step back from him for months to focus on myself. When he came back to say that he was ready to date me. He had made out that she was no longer in the picture anymore, and he hadn’t spoken to her since August when I cut things off with him. He said she had been reaching out to him expressing her feelings but he hasn’t been very responsive. \n\nWhen he asked to date me, he had written me a three-page letter, expressing his feelings and And told me that he is 90% ready for a relationship, but still wants to get to know me and date. I later learned that he wrote her a letter as well telling her that he wanted to take a step back and that they shouldn’t stay in each other’s lives as friends anymore.\n\nWhen I found this out, it made me really annoyed because I didn’t understand what he had to write her a letter. It made the letter that he wrote for me seem very unimportant and not meaningful.\n\nShe keeps messaging him, persisting to meet, and saying she has something to tell him. Before he said he wouldn’t meet her because of his boundaries and out of respect for what we’re building. Then now a few weeks later he is meeting her next week for “closure” and that until that door is closed he can’t fully be in this with me emotionally. WTF\n\nWhy does he need to meet her in person? Why can’t he just ignore her? His answer is that he wants to handle things of care and if she messages him after he meets her, he’ll ignore her, but I feel like this will continue to Drag on. What are your thoughts? \n\nI’m here for honesty but be respectful. \n\nTDLR; guy I’m dating is meeting up with the girl he had a situationship with to put closure to the end of their friendship.","completion":"There is no need for him to meet with her.

Also sometimes tells me what to wear (I don’t mind it), and also points out my flaws (which are genuine). I don’t mind these things at all, I appreciate the work she puts in. But I can’t help think of how this is what my mother used to do, and this makes me uncomfortable 😳; I don’t have an Oedipus complex 🤢. \nShould I be more manly? And ask her not to do these things? Should I put a stop to it? Idk, tbh as I said this is my first relationship I don’t know how to act.

Putting your head in your mother's lap... boys don't do that beyond about age 10. If you can't differentiate the affection you received as a child from romantic affection as an adult perhaps you should explore that in therapy. If you are/were receiving abundant physical affection from your mom as a teen and young adult, perhaps you need to explore that in therapy.\n\nYour girlfriend is not the problem here. Many couples cook and try recipes. A kiss on the cheek is cute-ish, but not necessarily weird. Maybe she does have a nurturing personality, but the fact that it immensely reminds you of your mom and you can't separate the two very different expressions of love tells us that you were babied by your mom and not really treated like a mature, independent young man with autonomy."}

It sounds like you had a very loving upbringing, far better than the alternative. It's more so in the established boundaries, or dependence between parent and child that things could have been a little greyed for you. Like, if you never dated in high school, then 100% of your emotional support in your teens came from your mom/parents. Your mother probably loved being the most important female in your life, not in a gross way, but in an endearing, \"yay-my-teen-still-talks-to-me-and-we're-close\" sort of way. Or she openly enjoyed taking care of you and she did a lot instead of letting you figure out some things for yourself and respecting your autonomy. She might have relied on you for her own entertainment and companionship instead of having her own hobbies, strong friend circle, or a strong loving bond with your father.\n\nThe love and affection from a romantic partner vs a mother should feel different. If things your girlfriend is doing are constantly reminding you of your mom and it is affecting your ability to enjoy the interaction, all I am saying is that it might be worth exploring some of your feelings in therapy. This is the first time you have ever received actual love from anyone other than your parents, it's not abnormal to take some time figuring out how to process it."}

I am currently on a 12 month maternity leave taking care of our 7 month old son.\n\nHere is where I am looking for advice.\n\nWhen he is around I ask him for help around the house or to watch our son while I do housework or try to grab a shower. His response is usually I'm trying to relax before having to work again or none of my friends or Co workers have to help their wives with the kids or house.\n\nHe says that all I do is sit around all day with our son and I'm on maternity leave so it's essentially a vacation. He says if I prioritized my days better I could shower and do housework while our son naps.\n\nThe rare time he does spend with our son he is telling me to hurry and get back or to come help him because he got spit up on or he puts him in his exersaucer with Ms Rachel and then lays on the couch with his phone.\n\nThere is also very little intimacy anymore because he says I'm such a nag and a B**** to be around that he doesn't want to be around me because he needs to relax when he's not working and being around me isn't relaxing.\n\nWhen I get upset he's not involved with our child or helping around the house he says he does more than I deserve (puts a roof over our head, etc).\n\nHe also expected me to have the pregnancy weight off by now and is constantly commenting on me eating and saying I just shouldn't eat even if I'm having some fruit.. he also thinks I should be working out while the baby sleeps or taking him for walks. I am struggling to shower 2-3 days and keep the house cleaned and his lunches packed and ready and keep the child alive and fed and changed let alone be able to work out.\n\nLike I appreciate he works hard for our family. But I honestly don't feel like a family anymore.\n\nI feel like a single mom even though I'm not. And sometimes I think it would be better to do it all alone instead of doing it alone with him here to remind me of just how little he does.","completion":"That's just devastating.

{"prompt":"My (28M) girlfriend's (23F) gay friend told her friends I'm trying to sleep with him. My girlfriend has this friend who is not too close but close, probably a 7/10 in a closeness scale. He is gay and kinda slutty, sees a lot of guys and likes to have fun. That's fine with me, power to that. \n\nAnyway, me and my gf were apart for some time and when we got back together she told me he once asked her if she'd be okay with him shooting his shot with me now that we were apart. I'm not going to lie, I was flattered, I think anyone would be. But I am not gay. Eventually we got back together after a year apart and we've been seeing each other for a couple of months, but just an hour ago she let me know that apparently, all of her friends think I'm secretly gay and trying to bang this guy because he told them so. She asked what was up. \n\nThis guy, let's call him Alex, is not only the friend of my gf but also friend of some other close friends of mine from way before I even knew my girlfriend, so I've always known him and though we have never been friends I did want to get to know him better at some pointso we could all hang out together. Last month, he tweeted something about wanting to die, so I dmd him and asked him if he was okay. He said yes, he was exaggerating and just stressed about a big decision he wanted to make. I didn't make much more conversation since I just wanted to reach out to an acquaintance that seemed upset, but he started messaging me more, asking how I was and where I was living, which I answered politely but wasn't too chatty. We happen to live very close to each other and he said we should party together sometimes and I said, sure why not, my girlfriend is out of town and I'm trying to make new friends and get out more since while she's not around all I do is miss her and being alone. He said yeah def let's go out you'll feel better. I was being honest here, he is a friend of friends and even though I knew he at one point asked my gf for \"permission\" to hit on me I didn't want to think he would not actually respect the relationship we had now or that me being polite had to mean I had any other intentions. \n\nAnyway that's where the conversation ended for about a week, then he texted me again once at 2 am and asked \"You up?\" I was but I didn't want to answer because it gave me a bad vibe, a you up at 2 am doesn't sound exactly friendly. So I waited until the next day, I replied \"I was asleep, you okay?\". He answered \"Yeah just was feeling crazy and wanted to ask if you wanted to go for a smoke\". I didn't answer anything anymore at all, and I told my gf. I told her how I did text him first asking how he was when he said he wanted to kill himself, how I answered in a friendly manner when he started chatting and how I'm starting to think it's not actually friendly and it's inappropriate. She just laughed it off being like \"Oh classic Alex\". \n\n\nToday, she told me she wanted to talk to me. Apparently, he has been telling their mutual friends I'm trying to get him to sleep with me and pushing for his attention. It honestly makes my blood boil. I have always been an advocate of gay and straight people being able to be friends without any other expectations or misunderstandings, that gay people should be able to to be friendly towards straight people without them thinking there's more to it than that, and now it turns out me being friendly towards him means I'm hitting on him and trying to fuck him? I'm so pissed off. My girlfriend is trying no to to stress too much but she obviously is and with a good reason, right now either her friend is lying or I am. She told me if I was curious about my sexuality or experimenting or straight up gay it was fun but I had to let her know, and if it was a lie or misunderstanding, to be more careful. I told her it was a lie and how pissed off I was. We couldn't talk muchore because she went to bed but right now I'm really pissed off and would like advice.\n\nI'm going to be honest here, I want to kick his ass. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt where maybe he misunderstood but I find it hard to believe and can't help but think he's just a mean, lying shit wanted to stir up drama for the heck of it, and that makes me want to fucking kick his ass. But I won't, I wouldn't.\n\nSo that leaves me with two choices, number one is just block him and move on. He's not really my friend, it doesn't really matter. My fear is, and maybe it comes from my insecurities, that I'm not really standing up for myself. I'm letting people talk and lie and think things that aren't there, not only that I'm gay, which at the end of the day it doesn't matter, though I don't like the idea of people thinking things that are just not true. But worse than that, that people think that I would hit on ANYONE while I'm dating my gf, who I love very much. I have never cheated, and I don't think I ever will. And to have people spreading lies that make you look like a shitty person is infuriating. And I think my girlfriend believes me, but I also now it is something that will itch from time to time, the thought of \"I know he wouldn't do that, but what if he would?\" And the fact that he caused that make me the most upset I've been in many years.\n\nMy other option I can think of is talking to him. I'm mad and I want to tell him to fuck himself and how shit of a person he is, and that he is the reason people can't be nice to each other, how he is sexualizing me from me trying to be friends. I want to tell him and everyone else he is a lying asshole. I don't think he DESERVES to have a nice, calm chat, but that's what I would try to do. Ask him to see me, let him know that it has come to my attention that people think I'm gay and that I \"think\" it may have to do with him, but maybe not. That I just wanted to make sure he understands that I am not gay, and that any conversation I've had with him has been me trying to make friends. That I hope there hasn't been a misunderstanding and that I'm sorry if there was, hoping we can be okay from now on. Of course, I have no intention to be okay with him and I couldn't care less about making him feel better or reassured or \"apologizing\" for any misunderstanding, since I think that is too much of a stretch and he knew exactly what he was doing. But I'm trying to protect my gf and myself, hoping that going for this maaaybe makes him realize what he did was wrong and maybe have him tell my gfs and his friends that he was wrong about me.\n\nIt wouldn't matter to me if it was a rando telling other randos lies, but this is an acquaintance telling close friends lies about me that affect me and my gf, and they'll obviously believe these things are true and judge my relationship and tell my gf to leave me because they heard it from someone who is their friend.\n\ntl;dr my gfs gay friend told her friends, but not her, that I'm trying to sleep with him, which is not true. I have talked to him trying to be friends and there's a slim chance he really misinterpreted things but I think the most likely thing is he's doing it with malice. My gf believes me but I can see it affects her and I don't know what to do to have things go back to normal without having to go tell each one of their friends \"I'm not gay and I wouldn't cheat on my gf, please believe me\". I'm incredibly angry.\n\nWhat do you think? I really need advice.","completion":"I agree! I feel so bad for the people he goes after. It just makes the situation worse. He never changes, just takes a small break until someone says or does something he things is soo stupid he has to chime in."}

{"prompt":"Should I 19f have returned my car because 23m boyfriend said to? I’m going to apologize in advance for how this might be formatted for I’m writing this on my phone. Sorry if it’s not perfect. \n\nI (19f) have a boyfriend (23m) who I’ve been dating for almost 7 months. For some backstory things have been off recently between us because we haven’t had much time for ourselves or each other due to us both working a lot. So this past weekend he asked for space to recharge and I gladly gave him it because honestly I needed it too.\n\nSo we took about two days to ourselves and during that time I bought a new car. It was something I was planning on doing anyways and i told him that previously the only thing I didn’t tell him was my plan changed. I was originally going to finance with my sister but things changed and I financed by myself which made my interest rate and car payment higher  because right now I have little credit and am a first time buyer\n\nNonetheless I still was very proud of myself. I was so excited about it but I didn’t tell him because we were taking some time to ourselves so I was planning on telling him later. I was so excited about my car I posted it on my snap story not thinking about it and forgetting he could see it. The next day rolls around and he texts me asking if I got a car and I told him I did. We talked for a bit then he started asking me what I thought were innocent questions.\n\n Such as “how much is the loan?” Or “what’s your payment like?”. I answered and at first he was supportive until he started asking more. Now again this car is my first car I bought by myself. My interest rate is really high and so is my car payment but I can refinance in six months and drop it by $200 and it’s a good way for me to earn credit considering I have no other major bills right now. Also the car I was in before was on its last legs. It was a 2009 Saturn and it was old and beat up.\n\n It maybe would’ve lasted me a few more months before I ended up on the side of the road. I tried to explain to him this but he starts to call me impulsive. Saying I shouldn’t have bought my car so impulsively and I should return it. He also started saying he was just trying to pass on the advice he got from his mom when he was my age and made impulsive decisions as well.\n\n This really bothered me. It hurt to think he thought I did this impulsively when I don’t think I did. With the way he worded everything he made me feel stupid as well. I expressed this and he continued to say he’s sorry for making me feel stupid but he is trying to teach me a lesson in finance. He is trying to protect me. \n\nHe goes on to tell me I went to a shitty dealership and is upset that I didn’t run my decision by him. He is upset I didn’t tell him what I was doing. This confused me because In no way are our finances tied. I don’t see why he is so upset because I’m my eyes this doesn’t affect him at all. I then told him I just wanted his support and not to be ridiculed and he proceeded to tell me he can’t fake support. \n\nIt’s almost been a week now and we haven’t talked since we fought last weekend. This has left me confused and upset because I thought I was doing the right thing. I also didn’t go alone I went with my mom to the dealership who helped me through the whole process and helped me make a plan. I can understand how he’d be upset that I didn’t tell him about it earlier but I don’t think it’s a decision I need to “run by him”. But should I have returned the car? \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend and I fought about me getting a new car. He called me impulsive and said I should return it and he can’t support my decision.

My interest rate is really high and so is my car payment but I can refinance in six months and drop it by $200 and it’s a good way for me to earn credit considering I have no other major bills right now.

{"prompt":"I(21m) have been torn apart by the actions of my girlfriend(29f) My girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me anymore. She doesn't even want me in the same car as her. I asked her to take me to the bank so I could take 60 dollars out and she seemed reluctant. During the whole car ride it felt like I was talking to myself and she would answer in an annoyed tone. It first started about a week after moving into WA. She started with just not being in the mood to speak and getting annoyed when I would try to lighten up her mood. She would ignore me and only speak when her cousin or my godmother spoke to her. After realizing that I asked her why she ignores me but only speaks to her cousin and my godmother. She asked me in an annoyed tone if I was jealous of both of them. I said no because it wasn't anything like that I was only hurt. She proceeds to say that she was also ignoring her cousin but her cousin will match the attitude and things will escalate. So I chose to stay out of her way. And only speak when I see that she is not in a mood. It's been a whole month and she has been the same way. About a week ago I found out she is thinking of ending things and moving out. I don't know what to do. She doesn't speak to me unless we are in front of my godmother. She seems tired of me. I don't know what I did. My godmother told me my GF wants space so I gave her space. It seems like giving her space came back to bite me in the ass. She doesn't seem to care about me anymore. She disappeared 2 days in a row. She dropped my stepkids to school and didn't come back the whole day while my godparents were gone. She never responded to me asking where she was. She only told me where she was when she came back. She said she was at her aunties house and that I had no reason to be worried because in the end she has her kids and they will be fine.(her kids were at school). I don't know what to do. I want to end things but I don't know how. This is my first relationship after 4 years. My previous relationship ended because my GF thought I was cheating on her with my cousin and didn't believe that I was related to her. So I got up and just left. This is a bit harder to just leave because of the connection I have with my stepkids. I told my stepkids that they will join me and my GF on a family date and now I don't know if I can keep my word. She has told them to leave me alone as we are playing because I need to study for the asvab. Which is crazy because I studied the whole day. I just wanted time with my stepkids so for her to tell them that it hurts me. What can I say to leave this relationship without making a big problem out of it. She doesn't seem to want to be with me anymore. My godmother noticed everything and has been speaking with her. My godmother asked her if she still cares about me and she said she doesn't know anymore. I want this relationship to last because before things got to this point our life together was great. Our sex life was great. We made each other happy by just speaking to each other and now it seems like she doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't know what to do.

This is a bit harder to just leave because of the connection I have with my stepkids. I told my stepkids that they will join me and my GF on a family date and now I don't know if I can keep my word. She has told them to leave me alone as we are playing because I need to study for the asvab. Which is crazy because I studied the whole day. I just wanted time with my stepkids so for her to tell them that it hurts me. What can I say to leave this relationship without making a big problem out of it. She doesn't seem to want to be with me anymore. My godmother noticed everything and has been speaking with her. My godmother asked her if she still cares about me and she said she doesn't know anymore. I want this relationship to last because before things got to this point our life together was great. Our sex life was great. We made each other happy by just speaking to each other and now it seems like she doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't know what to do. My connection with my stepkids is so strong that I consider them my kids despite only having been around them for 5 months. ( She is frustrated with a child abuse case against my cousin's husband). She doesn't seem to have the same feelings we once had for each other.","completion":"Walk away.  This whole situation is terrible.  For starters, you’ve only been dating for 5 months.  Those aren’t your “step kids”.  You probably shouldn’t have even met them yet, but that’s her decision on who she brings in and out of the their lives I guess.  To add to that, y’all are living together already?!  With the kids?  Nope, too soon.  But again, that’s my opinion.  The age difference, while I know you’re both legal adults, is pretty significant.  She’s almost 30 and you’re just out of your teenage years.  I’m not even going to touch on all the other family members who seem to be involved in this.  Just get out."}

If it's barely been a few days, then it's possible that she's still in that awkward phase after rejecting someone. The drunk text may not have been offensive, but it still might have weirded her out since she didn't want a relationship, said so, and then you texted her this second confession. You may need to give it some time. My suggestion is just to say \"Hi\" when you walk past and nothing else. Don't follow her, don't say anything else, don't get defensive, and don't try to bring up the text. Just \"Hi\". Sometimes a simple friendly hello can break the barrier. If she doesn't want to speak to you any further, then you'll know.\n\nIf she doesn't speak to you again, then sadly it just wasn't meant to be. For one reason or another, that text threw her off or she didn't like the confession. It would be best to leave it at that. and try to find new friends."}

In OP’s case, the kids are in school.  And if he has time to be questioning her about where she is during that time, and she has time to go wherever it was, they have time for lunch dates.  You don’t need a big support system to get a babysitter once in a while either.  The bottom line is, the kids come first.  If you have to forego dating because you have no one to stay with them for an hour or two here and there, then so be it.  When I started dating again after my divorce, my kids were kept completely out of it.  My now-husband, their stepfather, didn’t meet them until we had been together for almost a year.  I needed to be 100% sure that they would be safe around him, mentally and physically, and it was the healthiest thing for them to have him in their lives.  Did I think they’d be okay after a few months of dating him?  Yes, but that still wasn’t a risk I was willing to take."}

{"prompt":"I, (F30) and my husband (M31) owe my parents money that we don’t have to pay them back yet I’ll try to keep this as short as possible but basically I’ve always had a really rocky relationship with my parents. I had a rough childhood, my mom had a drug problem and my dad suffered mental health issues. I was the oldest of 4 kids so I think I experienced the most of this time and therefore didn’t have a “normal” childhood. By the time the 2 youngest siblings were growing up (twins, now 24) things had started to get better for my parents, my mom was in recovery and dad was in therapy. I think because I grew up mostly during the “bad times” I never had a connection to my parents, all I remember is a lot of chaos and feeling like they hated me most of the time. By the time I was a teenager and they were recovered from most of their problems and making more money, they decided to spoil the two youngest by providing them with everything that myself and my middle sibling never really got. Meanwhile, they still made the two of us work to provide for ourselves anything extra that wasn’t the essentials (they bought food, put a roof over our head, etc but if we wanted clothes or dresses for school dances or anything that wasn’t deemed essential, we were told to earn the money ourselves). This wouldn’t be so bad necessarily if not for the fact that at the same time we watched them buy the two youngest expensive laptops, clothes, and anything they wanted. It created a lot of resentment towards my parents.\n\nAt 19 I moved out, started college which I had to pay for out of pocket and with loans because my parents wouldn’t help pay for it, and worked full time to support myself. I stopped being able to afford my rent, food, and tuition and so my grades suffered and I was forced to drop out. After taking years off and working to support myself I eventually put myself through a bachelors and masters degree at top universities and am on track to having the career of my dreams - albeit a little later in life than I would have liked. During this time I watched though as my parents put my two youngest siblings through college, paying for all of their tuition, expenses, paying their rent, etc. I have never understood why they were so willing to help them but not me or our middle sibling. \n\nSo now to the current issue. My husband is an architect. We have been doing well for ourselves up until last year when his contract ended with one job and his next contract wasn’t starting for about 6 months. We had a savings but I was finishing my masters and not working at the time so we were running out of money. My parents have been doing really well the last several years - like owning multiple properties and retiring early well- I really didn’t want to ask them because of our past but my husbands family has no money and could not help even if they wanted to, so I ended up asking my parents to borrow some money. They agreed and said not to worry and to pay them back whenever we could, which I was shocked about because they never used to lend me anything and if I ever asked it was made into a huge deal and they would make me feel like sh** for even asking. I thought maybe things had changed. \n\nThat is until about a year later, we are still struggling to catch up from those 6 months of no income. My parents wanted me to fly to their home to basically dog sit while they took a 3 month world tour vacation. I told them I cannot take that time off work, to which my mom immediately threw in my face the money we owe them and started to demand I pay them back immediately. Now I’m being told that by not paying them back the 6000 we borrowed (yes, I know it’s a lot) that we are essentially ruining their plans of early retirement. \n\nI don’t know what to do because we just don’t have it yet. I also don’t understand why they have always had no problem paying everything for my youngest siblings (including 25,000 for one of their weddings and a deposit for one of their houses with no expectation of being paid back). \n\nI don’t feel like I’m entitled to their money and to be honest I wish more than anything that I could just give it all back to them right now but this whole things makes me feel like I never want to talk to them again… but then I feel guilty and like I’m being an entitled jerk. \n\nAny advice appreciated, even if it’s against me. I’d truly like an outside perspective. \n\nTL;DR parents paid for everything for youngest siblings but nothing for me and middle child, now holding money my husband and I borrowed from them a year ago over our heads.","completion":"Is living with him so traumatic that you can't wait for the 8 months it'd take to go live elsewhere without having to pay fines?\n\nLet's be realistic here and honestly weight the unpleasantness of your situation vs the financial side of things.

He lives far so I spend a lot of money o travel to see him and Ive been here for almost two months now, leaving this monday.\n\nHis lifestyle consists of doing music gigs at bars so hes often out drinking. I wanted to go out with him after work last night because I’m leaving soon and my only intention was to have fun with him. I could tell he was tired from work and he told me he wanted to go home and I was totally fine with it, I was even ready to book a cab home. But then some of his friends were out and they told us we could come so we ended up going. But the other friends that were with us at his job could see that he was not in the mood. One of them even told him \"no lets just go home we can play csgo\" and i think that friend got pissed that my boyfriend didnt end up going home so his friend unfollowed me on instagram and even ignored me after that. \n\nWhen we got home after the party I told my boyfriend that I’m sorry we went out I should have known better to go home when youre tired. Then he told me its common sense to know that hes tired and wants to go home, I should have seen it on his face and he shouldnt have to explain stuff like that. And that even his friends could tell he was in a bad mood.\n\nI understand him and I apologised but at the same time I cant read my boyfriend’s mind and I told him he needs to communicate. But he kept telling me he needs an adult relationship and someone mature that understands him and these are things he shouldnt have to explain.\n\nI feel misunderstood because when I’m away hes usually always out getting drunk x4 times a week and when I visit him hes putting all this blame on me. He never blamed his friends when they forced him to go out. \n\nThis is something that can be fixed and I feel so hurt he gave up on me so easily because I’m willing to change and improve what I’ve done. He never sees the good things I do for him, I wake up early in the morning to get him food before work and I bought him a gaming chair because I know he loves gaming, I traveled miles to visit him and I put so much effort into this relationship. He hasnt visited me once yet and he told me he dont know when he will. \nThe mistake of me going out w him last night affected his friend so bad until he doesnt even greet me or look at me anymore. I dont understand. \n\nI just dont know what to do, I feel so guilty and keep blaming myself. He would just be playing games with his friends all night and I’d be alone in bed.

I'll give you my point of view as a woman who does watch porn. (And for all the creeps in this sub, no my comment here is not an invitation for you to slide into my DMs.) So what I look at is not necessarily a reflection of what I want in real life. For example I like seeing men in porn that are very masculine, think quite buff, hairy, big dick, etc. In real life I would never go for someone like that, I'm 25 and I like to date men who are and look to be a similar age to me. And while big dicks look nice in a video it's not something I would choose for sex because it hurts. My ex was just slightly above average and we already had trouble with him hitting my cervix, so I really don't want a huge one. Considering this isn't what I really want it would also be ridiculous for my partner to become insecure or feel inadequate for not looking the same. It's just my own little fantasy in my head to get my imagination going. I do also watch amateur porn with more realistic scenes and bodies, but it's more so about imagining myself in a situation like this, it's not about the people in the video. And if i'm dating someone those scenarios usually make me think about my partner and what it would be like to do those things with him right now. So I also wouldn't take it i personally if my partner watched porn. Something I wouldn't accept is if he got off to picture to women he knows or people on social media, because then it's about him imagining being with that specific woman."}

But now it's actually scary what young people (especially men) have access to all for free. I'm not an anti porn guy but I really do hate what it's doing to the younger generation of men.  And daily usage is very unhealthy.\n\nThat being said, occasionally watching it and especially having thoughts about other women is basically impossible for young men to suppress. It's nothing personal about you or definitely doesn't mean you aren't good enough, it's just the way our brains are wired when we're young.  It's not on you or anything you're doing wrong."}
{"prompt":"F21 M20 Pornography insecurities Hello I’m F(21) my boyfriend is M(20), Now for years note I’ve struggled with my self image…my own acceptance of my looks and my body. I’ve always just given my all (more than I should) to people and ruined it; my boyfriend before he met me, said porn was an addiction, his everyday thing, consistently. And he expressed he didn’t want to be addicted like he was. But I’ve never understood porn, or the reason to use it. And it hurts me that he wants to do it to other women other than me… and I know that’s not right, I know I shouldn’t let it bother me or eat at me but I do, and I’m not sure how to stop it, and I don’t understand it all. He has thoughts about people that he sees at work, and stuff like that and it eats at me and I feel like I’m not enough, but then I see that it’s meant to be normal, that people need to look.

There’s plenty of relationships and marriages that fail because of obsessive porn use. Also, watching porn every day is not “normal”. A lot of people (especially men) will always try and justify daily porn use saying “all men do it” but that is simply not true. For me personally it became a big issue in my relationship when my partner decided he would rather watch porn than he intimate with me. Porn ruins intimacy for a lot of people. It’s just as addicting as street drugs, and it quite literally alerts part of the brain. It sounds like your partner is self aware of his addiction, which is a good sign. A lot of men and women who are addicted to porn will find sex addiction therapy to be very helpful. If that isnt an option, there are books that can be read and plenty of articles on the internet that can help you cope with how you feel and help your partner through his recovery. There are even subs on here that are dedicated to porn addiction recovery. You’re allowed to feel however you feel about it and don’t owe anyone any explanation on why you feel that way. It’s normal to want your partner to not lust over other people."}

{"prompt":"Am i (28F) taking my pregnancy rage out on my husband's (31M) best friend? Just background info: Currently entering my third trimester and i am hella emotional so if I'm being an AH or in the wrong please do tell me because i might just be in my head about this shit. \n\nThis is gonna be a LONG post. I apologize profusely. \n\n\nMy husband (N) has a best friend from middle school (A) who I've known as long as I've known my husband which is basically going on 11years now. Started as friends dated for 5 years been married for 2. \n\nThey are basically alot alike apart from the fact that A is  my age but acts alot more like a frat boy. My husband is also alot silly especially when with his friends but he's definitely the dad in the group. Always the designated driver/makes plans/ makes sure no one does stupid shit while they are out or get hurt type dude. \n\nMy husband and i have a pretty good relationship and good communication and i love him very much. He's a good person and i know he's gonna be a great dad. He spends most of his time with the same group of friends especially with A and when we were still dating they got into alot of stupid shit together which i kinda just brushed off as boys being boys. For example getting hurt while trying to do a stupid trick/ or feeling sick because they had some random drinking challenge. \n\nBut also some more dangerous type of situations i kinda jst brushed away because they are grown men. (Getting into bar fights or getting too drunk to even drive and had to sleep in the car overnight without letting me know if he was okay while having made plans to come home at a certain time) before our wedding. Which my family was very concerned about. \n\n\nI will say I'm a bit of a pushover yet the worrywart most definitely in the relationship and i try not to fight. So i just tell him I'm not happy about such recklessness and move on.\n\nHe's significantly cut down this behavior however after we got married because i hated it.  \n I've had to speak to him alot because i feel like A takes advantage of N alot. N drives but lost his license and didnt bother to get it renewed for a long time. So he would expect my husband to drop him off and pick him up whenever he wanted to go out. Or to go out with him alot. Which i don't mind except for when they did N would come home at like 4am-6am while i was at home alone. And we discussed him not coming in tht late because we live in a sketchy area and when people would see the car isn't there all hours of the night regularly they wld know he isn't home and that would fuck with my anxiety alot. \n\nOr we had plans to do stuff the next day bt he wld be too tired after his night out and sleep all day. \n\nSo it became a once in a while topic id bring up because it wasn't as frequent anymore.\n\nSince I've gotten pregnant it's been a very difficult pregnancy with me in alot of pain and alot less patience. N hasn't been going out as much which i appreciate but A is still always around. And honestly his childish behavior as just become such a trigger for me. How he would call my husband at all hours last minute to take him somewhere, or how N would be delayed from coming home because he's with A having a drink, and this week how we were at a family bday dinner for my aunt and A went to a different town over the weekend. He didn't plan on how he was coming back home and was calling N at 8pm asking him to come fetch him which was an hour's drive away and we were having shitty misty and heavily rainy weather.\n\nSo i got very very pissed and said NO. He wasn't going anywhere. I told him A is 29! He's an adult who should've accounted for visitng out of town and how he wldve gotten back home and not waited till the last moment to expect N to just pick up where he messed up. I told him he is my husband i need to make sure he's safe. It's a terrible idea driving in terrible weather into the mountains and at night during a power outage no less. I told him idc how A gets home he should've made a plan. He's grown! \n\nN didn't see A much after this happened (Monday) and last night N came home terribly exhausted from work not feeling well. A tried calling and his phone was off so he called me and i told him N is sleeping he basically passed out and he isn't well. He told me to wake him up they were gonna go out for drinks. I told him No he is literally burning up and he's sleeping i didn't feel right waking him. I tried before just to get him out of his work clothes and he didn't even have the energy to do that. And A still came and hooted outside the house. I did try to wake N up but he just tld me to leave him alone sleepily. \n\nTold A this and he wasn't very happy but left. Woke up to N being extremely sick in the middle of the night and having to med him up. \n\nI told N this morning who had no recollection of me even trying to wake him that's how exhausted he was.\n\n\n tld me he had made plans with A to go see a game tomorrow so he wnt be around for alot of tomorrow because of it. I said cool I'm visit my family then. N calls me from work saying he wanted to go out with A for drinks today since he flaked yesterday. I told him it's fine bt i wont see him tomorrow really so he shldnt be too late i wanted to spend some.time with him. He said he wont be and i jokingly said A needs to learn he can't monopolize all your weekend free time. To which he got quiet and asked me if i was being upset over nothing again? He had mentioned before that lately i am alot more grumpy and aggitated. Which isn't a lie.. i am very short fused lately and can honestly blame my hormones for it. Idk why i even get so mad most of the time unfortunately. \n\nI was like wtf no. And i just said okay then. Not wanting to get into a fight. \n\n My aunt having heard this while i was visiting her today has the running joke in my family being that i should make place in our bed for A because he's basically a 3rd in our marriage asked if they were gonna go out again. I just said yes. And my aunt kinda just said i shldnt let A come between my husband and I with his bullshit. \n\n Which i think my husband might have heard because he just said bye after and dropped the call.\n\nMy family has heard many a instances of their recklessness even from both of them that they thought were just unbecoming or worrysome. \n\nTrouble rn is N went out with A and a bunch of friends showed up at my aunts and looked very grumpy. Telling me he's gona go drop a friend and come bk to fetch me.  Then came bk in with A in tow and said no he's gonna let A take the friend home and we can go. My aunt made a comment when she saw A saying \"oh the bf is here again\"\n\nTo which my husband didnt look very happy about. I got my things and when i got outside A was asking me wtf i said to  N that made him change his mind and i said i said nothing and he huffed off. We got into the car in silence and my husband went straight to the room and slept. \n\n I feel hella awkward. Idk what to say. Should i apologize? I do feel like i get very defensive when he's out with A simply because he's had alot of instances of breaking his word in saying he's gonna be somewhere and come bk at a certain time and then stayed out all night because of A. I feel like he acts alot different when with him and alot more reckless especially with alcohol which worries me alot more now that we are actually expecting a literal child. I feel myself getting very angry when he had plans with A because i know.. that everytime it's honestly some bullshit he gets dragged into and it's exhausting being worried all the time when i don't give a crap if he goes out with other friends because that's never the issue with anyone other than A. \n\nAm i taking out my hormones on his bestie and pushing him away? Do i need to chill tf out? Please do tell me I'm asking sincerely. I know my husband has a very demanding job and he needs to relax sometimes and i don't have any issues with it and have told him this. I just don't want to be worried everytime he goes out that i can't get ahold of him or he gets stuck having to sleep for a few hours because he got too high with A and can't drive home when we discussed. (This happened last month) especially now with the baby. \n\nI'm just kinda confused rn. And to be clear i have no issue with my husband having friends or going out at all. He's a grown ass man. Who needs his own space too. He just doesn't ever stick to his word when with A spesifically.","completion":"NTA\n\nThere isn't treatment for HPV and she has the right to know about her risks of exposure to it especially being pregnant as it can be transmitted during childbirth though that risk is very low.

{"prompt":"Should I tell them? I’m battling my inner emotions to tell my best friend how I feel about them. Mostly because I shouldn’t like them in the first place. (We both dated each others best friends). \n\nHonestly, I think that they already know, but it’s one of those unspoken things that neither of us are choosing to address. We have had a few moments recently that have maybe intensified my already existing feelings, feelings that maybe have existed for years. But i’ve always suppressed them. Mostly because they were in a relationship when we first met. And I entered a relationship soon after. And the significant others of both of those relationships ended up becoming our best friends. (Their ex-partner is my current best friend/ vice versa.) I am terrified to hurt my best friend. \n\nNow however, my internal conflict is, is I feel as though they definitely know, or at least suspect. And if so, they seem to be trying to pursue something with everyone else expect me. Which is fine, it’s not like i’m doing anything about it either. I don’t know what to do about it. I could just let it go. But I can’t help but feel like there’s something more. They’re already my best friend, and we are crossing “friend” boundaries as time passes. Expect i’m beginning to feel uncomfortable that we are, because we don’t address it. I’m not very good at setting personal boundaries, which is terrible. But I just was never taught, nor do I know how to. I just can’t think of another person who I enjoy to spend my time with any more than them, so I let myself slip away in the moments. But maybe i’m disrespecting myself by doing so and not setting any boundary- which I don’t even know what that would be. I’m definitely super emotional at the moment and overthinking a lot of internal things at the moment. Just in my head. \n\nBut now I feel as though I have a time limit to either openly express my feelings or keep it within. They are leaving the country for a few months in about 45 days. Not sure if they’ll come back. Most likely but there’s a chance they won’t. \n\nWhat should I do? \n\nI know I could be treated better regardless, but I can’t help the way I feel about this person.","completion":"You're not just thinking about her wellbeing, but the babies too.

We have 2 coffee grinders, one he uses for grinding spices and I have one for coffee beans that I basically never use. I randomly decided to grind coffee today (usually we use ore ground coffee) and saw that “my” grinder was dirty that he used it for his uses. I also thought that it was broken because 2 pieces were stuck together. I started “talking to myself” thoughtlessly saying why would you use that, why would you do that? In my mind I didn’t even think about what I was saying. He was in the other room within ear shot. He came in and fixed the grinder, said sorry I said it’s ok… it was all really a blur, I think I said something like why would you use that it’s mine or something. In my head I’m “half kidding” because that’s not something I was ACTUALLY upset about.

Since he works in a restaurant he spends most of his day there, around 10 to 12 hours, and has just one day off.\n\nHe really likes his job, and usually talks about his coworkers, but mainly 3 of them which works in the kitchen with him, and one of them who references from time to time is this girl that's my same age, I'll call her G. He always talked about her like he's annoyed by her, mainly because he said she's self-centered and talks too much, but also because in his opinion is not that competent and other things. \n\nOne time he told me they argued at work and she pushed him when walking past him, but he didn't say anything to her to avoid conflict (which is something he usually does) and they didn't talk almost anymore since then, which happened like 4 months ago. Also because they don't have to help each other to prepare the same food at work anymore.\n\nIn the last month though, he said he felt guilty because she cried at work. What happened is that while she was arguing with a coworker, she kept ranting and trying to put him down, so my bf asked her to stop. Then she cried and he felt guilty. Yesterday night I asked him how he's doing and he said \"it's not easy to explain\" then started talking about this argument that happened at work which involved G and 2 other coworkers but not him.\n\nIn the end he told me something like \"I'm annoyed by her but this time she's kind of right\" (regarding the argument).

We have been in a relationship for a while, and I have always made it clear to her that I am uncomfortable with her being in contact with her exes. We had set mutual boundaries for the relationship, and she agreed to it. However, recently I found out that she has been lying to me and keeping in touch with her exes.\n\nShe lied to me about meeting one of her exes and kept her dog with him. Later, when he texted her for a favor while we were together, she lied to me again. After some comforting from my side, she admitted that she chatted with one of her other exes when he reached out to check on her. She keeps bringing up her past relationships and even mentioned a funny story about one of her exes while we were having a romantic moment.\n\nAll of this has led to me losing trust in her, and she's blaming me for not trusting her and making her stressed out. It has started to impact our relationship, and we're getting into fights over it. We're supposed to get married in a week, and things are only getting worse.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I call off the wedding? I love her, but I don't want to start a marriage with trust issues. Any advice would be appreciated.","completion":"Yikes, that wedding is *soon*.

The loss of a parent is one of the hardest things a person can go through. This is the person that gave you life. Your reaction to your GF is VERY understandable. You both are at the point where you’re in a serious relationship. Life only gets harder and you will experience more loss. Unfortunately that’s how life works the older we get. If your partner is oblivious to your feelings it’s going to create even more issues down the road. It may also lead to a lot of resentment on your part. Think about if she lost a parent? Would she react the same way how she did about your mom’s passing? Or would her loss be more important than yours? If that’s the case, will you feel resentment towards her? If marriage and children is some thing you hope for in the future there are so many other things that may happen throughout your life and you’re going to need your partner to be there as your teammate and to support you through it. In my opinion, a relationship is nothing if there is not trust, support, and loyalty."}

{"prompt":"my bf [M19] and I [F23] have been together a year. we started dating 3 days after hanging out and we moved in together right away. and lately i’ve been realizing there’s a alot of things that can’t be right. i’ll start with the worst part. my bf says things like he will kill my family, me and my dog. he has intense temper tantrums over minor inconveniences. he will start screaming at the top of his lungs, kicking shit and freaking out. It seems constant and i can feel it traumatizing me. it usually ends up him crying and me comforting. he never shows aggression toward me but when he’s upset he can be rude. he says things like shut the f*** up when i’m trying to be nice and compassionate. somehow it ends up feeling like my fault cause i didn’t know he needed a hug or i didn’t know he didn’t want to talk and i kept asking why he’s ignoring me when i’m asking a simple question. he also screams and kicks stuff so frequently my dog will shake and tremble with fear, he can be mean to my dog as well. he constantly says he treats me like shit and i think i try to deny it. now im starting to see and accept it but im not sure if im dealing with his mental illness or just his personality. these episodes he has are familiar to him.  his mind is dark, he talks about death and he doesn’t trust that people genuinely care for him. I want to be there for him but I also want to be safe and happy and keep my family and dog safe.","completion":"Who cares if it’s his mental illness or his personality?

At first it was nice but now I’m just feeling like I’m being interrogated/feel overwhelmed. Was involved with a controlling guy a year ago and I’m worried the situation will pan out like that but maybe I’m just paranoid? Any advice?","completion":"That's great for him if he's really doing the work. (Sounds to me like your instincts doesn't buy into  it, and mine don't either) but if he is really trying to do something, you will effectively undo any learning he's doing right now by staying with him. Once you're back in his life full-time, he's just learned the level of violence you're willing to live with on a daily basis and how far he has to go to actually get in trouble with you. And he will want to get in trouble with you again. And again. And again. \n\nOn top of that, at some point he's going to punish you for this episode too. It will be your fault that you both moved home. He needs some solitude and some perspective. That's what he actually needs. Stay the fuck away, like everyone here is telling you to. Best way to ensure that you both live and heal. \n\nAbuse has a cycle. The best way to be *truly*supportive is to break things off and set very clear boundaries around contact.

The worst case scenario you're building up in your mind, could happen no matter what you decide to do. He could act out if you go no contact. He could act out if you maintain contact but really it turns into an unhealthy entanglement. He could act out if you break up but keep polite conversation periodically. He could act out if you stay with him. You have NO control over how he turns out. When the bomb clock is ticking, we don't hem and haw about if we should try and toss it in the dumpster or try to dismantle it ourselves. We don't put it on the nightstand and pretend it is still just an alarm clock. We fucking run for cover. His soul and his heart are his own to save and he's more capable than he'd have you believe.

Please get some help from an agency that specializes in domestic abuse because you and your dog are in a very dangerous situation. He may have a personality disorder but it really doesn't matter why because he will not get help for his rage since he hasn't done it by 23.   \n\n\nAnger can be a way he's learned to control people close to him because they are afraid of him. When your dog is even shakng and trembling with fear you know it is time to get out of this situation. You cannot help him. This behavior may be how a parent treated him as a child. It is often passed down from father to son.   \n\n\nThe aggression isn't toward you yet, but it will be. The screaming, threatening to kill your famlly, kicking and throwing things is  form of control by showing you how anger \"makes him\" behave like a crazy person. People living like you learn to walk on eggshells to not upset the rager, but it never works. Often there are cycles of violence where the person explodes and beats his partner then is very sorry and swears it will never happen again. But it does and gets more frequent and violent.   \n\n\nHas he isolated you from family and friends by his behavior yet? That usually happens because the victim is embarrassed by the partners behavior and doesn't want friends and family to know about it.   \n\n\nYou should have enough for a restraining order that you can get in your local court. Many cities have help there and you can fill out the papers and see a judge the same day. Then he is served and the police remove him from the home. But you want to get help and advice first because the most dangerous time is when you try to leave.  \n\n\nI would get someone else to care for your dog temporarily because these guys often kill or injure pets to retain control over you. See if you can get help from family or friends to stay somewhere else or if your town has some help."}

How do I continue being with him without worrying about the age gap?","completion":"This isn't about age at all. 5 years is not an age gap for adults. The problem isn't age. The problem is you feel pressure to \"get your life together\" and are attaching that to an age. You aren't in high school anymore, back then age mattered as a goal for getting to the next grade, getting to your driver's license, getting whatever. Life isn't that strict, go at your own speed girl. You aren't a loser. Dropping out of college, living with parents, not having a 'career'; none of those things make you a loser. You can go at whatever speed that makes you happy. \n\nI have a great friend that owned multiple houses by 22. I have great friends that lived with parents until late 20s. I have great friends that dropped out of college due to stress and are happy with their jobs now. I have a great friend that had to drop out of college to move home and take care if her dad. I had classmates in college in their 40s. I went to college right after high school, dropped out with bad grades, then went back 5 years later and got a degree. One day at a time simply working on being better than you used to be.\n\nYour bf and his friends are supportive of you. They like hanging out with you. Do you have goals? Work toward those goals as slowly as you need to. You can't just say \"I need to acclomplish x y z by the age 26\" because it doesn't work that way. Many people hate the questions like \"so what do you do\", you'd be surprised how many people feel like they don't have their shit together when put on the spot like that. That's why I say age isn't the issue. If you keep making age the issue then you get depressed when you see somebody your age with certain accomplishments. For instance if you had that exact conversation with people age 24 would you still be thinking this is an age issue? There are plenty of people age 24 with the same level of \"shit together\" as those older friends, that doesn't mean you are worth any less than them. We all have pitfalls in life. They sound like great friends, except that friend you cried to and thinks this is an age gap issue. I'd get rid of her."}

{"prompt":"Fwb(26M) cried about losing me(21F) I met my FWB on tinder a couple of months ago. Every week he’d drive to my house and spend time with me and we wouldn’t always have sex. He’d be super affectionate and cuddle me for hours without letting go and kiss my face etc. Day two of meeting him he said he doesn’t want a relationship primarily bc he has seizures and his life is complicated because of that. Every week we’d spend more and more time together consisting of him driving to me even though it’s not safe for him to drive. \n\nA week ago he went on a trip to a nearby city and contracted herpes (not sure which type) from having sec with someone else. The week he returned he texting me saying he really wants to come see me but is sick. I found out at the end of the week that he just didn’t want to see me bc he didn’t have all of the information about the situation yet and didn’t know how to tell me. I told him that I don’t know if I can keep seeing him bc he lied to me, and that’s the only thing I hate. I feel like he went out of his way to form a lie when he could have never texted saying he wants to see me but can’t bc he’s sick or could have just told me the situation right out.\n\nHe said he was afraid of how I’d react even though I’m super calm all of the time. He didn’t know how to bring it up. He cried when I said I’m going to have to decide whether or not I want to continue seeing him. \n\nI can’t decide what to do in this situation. Part of me wants to cut him off bc my one rule was to not lie to me. I really enjoy all of the time we’ve spent together but him lying to me triggers me. I don’t know if I’m over reacting. Know he’s begging me not to remove him from my life. How do I go about this?\n\nTLDR: \nFWB (26M) and I (22F) have gotten really close in the past four months. We’ve been very affectionate and seeing each other around four times a week not always having sex but sometimes just cuddling. He went on a trip, contracted herpes (not sure which type) and when he came back he randomly texted me saying he wants to see me but can’t bc he’s sick. I he told me five days later what the truth was in person. He lied about being sick bc he wasn’t sure how to tell me about his test results. I told him I’m not sure I will keep him in my life bc my only rule was to not lie to me. He cried and is begging me to let him stay in my life. I understand that he lied bc he was scared but my previous trauma tells me I should have 0 tolerance. I want to keep seeing him bc I’ve enjoyed every moment with him but it sucks that he lied. \n\nWhy did he cry and what should I do?","completion":"It’s actually really common for people to get horrifyingly sick when they catch herpes, and they don’t find out that’s what causing it until they go in and get tested. If he was lying about being sick he may have been lying about when he contracted it; he could have had it for years and decided to finally tell you about it now but chose to do so in a way that would make it seem like he hadn’t been lying to you about it all this time."}
{"prompt":"I (M24) am having doubts regarding my relationship with gf (F23) Hey! Hope you're all doing well!\n\n\nI (M24) introduced my girlfriend of 2 months to my family today (F23). Look the dinner went super smooth, everybody was very sociable and overall it was a great time. I've known her for 2 years ±\n\nMy parents like her!\n\nMy sister, who's opinion I value lots, sat me down after, we spoke a little. Said that my gf is very kind, sweet, but something is off. She seems a tad clingy as well (always sat next to me like a magnet lmao, dabbing me up during dinner, etc.). Both my girlfriend's sisters are slightly older than us and already engaged, and my sister believes that my gf is somewhat feeling the pressure and attempting to find her own SO for eventual marriage. \n\nMy position on all this is that she's a really nice, kind, sweet, caring girl. We're currently in a relationship, and I have warm feelings for her, I like her. Obviously there's things lacking, but I'm also lacking as a person. That being said, I'm not 100% sure I love her just yet..\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to date her, while remaining open minded, without the \"dating to marry\" aspect. If it happens, cool... Though if I'm not feeling it after a while, I'll definitely end it. \n\nShould I continue to date her if I'm still uncertain about the long term viability? It's early days but I don't want to hurt her. I'm thinking of doing a 2-3 month tester and if I'm still feeling this way, I'll end it.\n\nTLDR: I am dating my gf for about 2 months now. Introduced her to my family for dinner tonight. Went well. Sister mentioned that she found her somewhat clingy, something was off about my gf.. though overall sweet and kind. I don't fully disagree with some of her points, and though I really like her... Not sure I'm 100% in love and see a marriage future with her just yet.","completion":"To have a mutually beneficial FWB situation; you need to be comfortable that the other person isn't jeopardising your own sexual health by being lax about protection if and when they are with other people.\nIt would be impossible for me to trust someone again after they tried to cover up both the fact they're sleeping around - and the fact they had contracted an STI."}
